FOAF Co-reference Based Entity Disambiguation Engine In Apache Stanbol,Apache Software Foundation,Dileepa Jayakody,"The proposed project mainly focuses on developing an 'Entity Disambiguation Engine'in Apache Stanbol by computing co-referent relations in friend-of-a-friend (FOAF) data-sets. The same entity (persons, organizations) can be referred by different names and vice-versa on the web which leads to the 'named ambiguity' problem of entities. This problem can affect the accuracy and relevance of results inferred by semantic engines and leads to the requirement of using effective disambiguation techniques to process entities as part of the enhancement process in the semantic engines. This proposal focuses on using FOAF profiles as a datasource and process them to resolve name ambiguity problem in an effective way. FOAF is a vocabulary used to describe people, organizations and groups in the form of linked data to form an entity network on the web. The relationship of these FOAF instances can be very useful to derive new knowledge about entities using semantic techniques. Some of the FOAF instances may denote the same entity in different approaches with different information. Therefore it's essential to identify which FOAF instances are describing the same entity over the web and identify the co-reference relationship between them. The co-reference analysis can use FOAF attributes such as mbox, homepage, weblog, as unique identifiers (inverse functional properties) to match FOAF instances to identify co-referent clusters and use it to disambiguate entities over the web. This project aims to develop a comprehensive disambiguation algorithm by identifying and clustering co-referent FOAF instances which describes the same entity over the web. Furthermore, integration of FOAF profile support in Stanbol can be useful to develop a user network in content management systems and improve access control of content using social graph techniques.

Wider spectrum of data sources for Apache Giraph using Apache Gora,Apache Software Foundation,J MM,"Apache Giraph is a graph-processing framework which can be used as regular Hadoop jobs in order to leverage existing Hadoop infrastructure. Giraph has been built taking into consideration the Pregel paper[1] but adds fault-tolerance to the coordinator process using Apache ZooKeeper as its centralized coordination service. It uses the bulk-synchronous parallel model relative to graphs in which vertices send messages to other vertices in a given superstep. In this manner, Apache Gora could provide a new vertex input format for Giraph and help Giraph provide a wider spectrum of data sources where graph processing could be done and stored. As Gora provides access to different data stores, the best configuration parameters for each one of them should be tested in a graph-processing framework. This could be done by testing specific parameters in well known algorithms implemented in Giraph e.g. PageRank, shared connections, or others."

Each Erlang package is identified by its publisher, name and version. These packages may in turn depend on other packages and so on. This leads to generation of a direct acyclic graph (DAG) of applications and packages which depend on each other. To build the original application, all the dependent packages must be built first. In this case we traverse from bottom of the tree to the top in DAG. It has to manage all the repositories to various packages published by publishers. It will fetch the source code of all the packages whenever an application depends on them if they are already not present locally.Now the build tool can reference to these packages while building the original project. Assembler can, then, assemble the release which is ready to be used. Finally the programmer may want to publish this application as a package. The focus of this project is to write the package manager of the dependent packages for erlang applications. The compatibility of this tool with the existing tools like Erlang builder, dependency manager etc. is very crucial to the project."
MongooseIM: Implementation of XEP-0313 Message Archive Management,BEAM Community,Uvarov Michael,"It is a common desire for a user using XMPP for IM to want to store their messages in a central archive on their server.

Dependency Graph and Evaluation Engine Refactor,Blender Foundation,Aligorith,"For many years, Blender’s dependency graph and evaluation engine has been long overdue for refactoring. Despite various key subsystems in Blender having already been refactored to become more flexible and powerful in the hands of skilled artists, it has become increasingly clear that artists are currently unable to fully harness the full potential capabilities of these tools due to limitations imposed by the current dependency graph engine. This project aims to investigate and resolve the various design issues involved in creating a new future-proof dependency graph system, and will result in an initial implementation of relevant core components."

Viewport FX II,Blender Foundation,Jason Wilkins,"This is a proposal to continue updating the way Blender draws to the screen. Blender relies on an older version of the OpenGL graphics library that is no longer fully supported by hardware providers. For this reason, when new generations of graphics cards are released, Blender will not fully benefit from the increases in capability and performance. In addition, new mobile devices show every indication of becoming the primary means by which most people use computers. For this reason, Blender and its game engine should be made to work with OpenGL ES, which was designed for those kinds of systems."

Implementing an SMS-based interaction module for uReport based on Open311 Standard,"Bloomington, IN, USA",Abhiroop Bhatnagar,"Currently, citizens interact with uReport through either a web interface or through iPhone/Android app. I propose to build a SMS based front end for uReport. This module will have two parts. First would be the web-based app which would handle the incoming SMS responses and generate replies for them. Second would be the Configuration Panel, which will be part of Web Proxy."
Mapping module on uReport - City of Bloomington,"Bloomington, IN, USA",Quan Zhang,"The city of Bloomington has a web application uReport to receive the issues reported by citizens. Now the city's database stored more than 70,000 tickets. In the main page of the web application, the users need to see the tickets on the map. Also they can filter tickets by choosing properties as search parameters. However, a problem rose. If we show all the tickets as markers on the map at a time, the map will be full of markers. Also, displaying the markers will take a long time. What's worse, the client will receive tickets from Solr server. The time to transmit tickets data from server to client will also be too long to accept. We need to cluster markers on server side and transmit the clusters instead of tickets to the map of the client."
New user interface and map-based browsing or GeoReporter for iPad,"Bloomington, IN, USA",Marius Constantinescu,"GeoReporter could benefit a lot from an improved user interface, which offers a much better user experience. I have run usability tests for the current interface and come up with a new prototype. In the second part of the summer, depending whether the functionality for location-based queries will be added to the Open311 Server specifications, I will either develop a map-based browsing feature for GeoReporter, or an iPad interface.The map-based browsing would use a feature of the Open311 Server which we hope will be implemented as soon as possible, and which will allow to search reports based on the location (latitude and longitude). I would also use this new feature to show the user similar reports when he is creating a new one.GeoReporter for iPad will be the iPad version of the current app. I will focus mostly on creating the user interface, since most of the code can be reused. The choice between GeoReporter for iPad and map-based browsing will be made depending on the progress with the Open311 implementation and together with the mentors."

Consolidating and Adding the Image Processing Functions to LIBICV ,BRL-CAD,Mohit Daga,BRL-CAD has a number of image processing tools. Currently all the tools are implemented in a modular fashion where in each tool is accessed as a module. The primitive task of this project is to combine the image processing functionalities of these tools to a library. This task will ensure the reusability of these functionalities by the application programmer through relevant api calls in the code and thus will be useful for building a proper GUI for BRL-CAD and helpful in other new tools/functions to be added to BRL-CAD in future. 
Implementation of a heart primitive,BRL-CAD,Isaac Kamga,"In our world today , we observe that all solid objects are simply combinations of basic ones like cubes,spheres,cones,etc and we frequently have to manipulate objects which have surfaces such as gadgets and devices . With the explosion in ubiquitous technology, Computer-aided design (CAD) software helps us create digital content in adverts and movies as well as visualize some solid objects like perfume bottles and shampoo before they are actually manufactured. In this project, we propose that BRL-CAD, which aspires to be the best CAD software, should incorporate a heart, a symbol of love, into its core functionality as one of its basic solid objects in order to increase its customer base and differentiate itself amongst its competitors. Indeed, this heart structure ( also called a heart primitive ) shall be used by those producing cartoons and designing electronic cards, gifts and presents during celebrations such as birthdays, weddings,family reunions, anniversaries and Valentine's day which deeply appeals to many individuals,families and communities.So during the summer, this heart primitive will be included into the raytrace library as a set of routines with corresponding support added to other parts of the source code."
Matrix Pull Routine for performing the opposite of the Matrix Push on Geometry.,BRL-CAD,Nyah Check,"The pull routine takes a specific node on a CSG tree, walking down to the primitive shapes restoring the geometric transformations(scaling, translation or rotations) at each stage down the CSG tree traversal based on reversing all the geometric transformations that occurred on the primitive shapes located at the leaf. Pull routine also stores the local coordinate systems at each point during the traversal from the primitives up to the given initial node. All transformation matrices visited along the tree will be set to their original transformation matrices.This command will fail if no changes occurred to the primitive shapes at the leaves of the csg tree."
New Cross-Platform 3D Display Manager,BRL-CAD,Simion Vlad Bogolin,The purpose of this project is to create a new cross-platform 3D display manager.

NURBS Intersection,BRL-CAD,Jianbang Wu,"BRL-CAD currently has a routine to compute the intersection curves of two NURBS surfaces, and in general cases it works well, but to get a more robust one, I still need lots of work on it this summer. Lots of tests and verification are needed, and maybe a TDD (Test Driven Development) can be used in this step. To get the SSI working in all cases, no matter what the input is like is very important, otherwise it would be useless.In this summer, if there is enough time, I would like to finish the remaining parts of evaluating NURBS, and finally offer a routine to convert CSG combination objects to evaluated NURBS objects. The work includes partitioning a surface, and building the new NURBS geometry. If there's still some time remaining, I will tried to do more tests and verification to make the implementation better."
STEP Libraries,BRL-CAD,Kesha Shah,"STEP is the current standard for exchange of CAD data between different software packages. BRL-CAD makes use of the NIST STEP Class Libraries code to support its step-g converter, but this source code was written before many current C++ standard practices and libraries were finalized. As a consequence, it needs both cleanup and performance enhancements. "

OBIX defines a standard for messages and end points representation so that enables interoperability between automated devices in smart buildings. The current OBIX standard currently lacks a service discovery mechanism that allows client applications to access OBIX servers without knowing the server addresses in advanced. This project contributes to the IoTSyS project, which uses OBIX as the underlying standard, by designing an appropriate service discovery (SD) method for the IoTSyS gateway. Furthermore, this project also participates in redesigning the IoTSyS OBIX object container to improve the way objects are addressed, stored and retrieved."
[IOTSYS] oBIX 1.1 Specification WD Implementation,Computational Science and Engineering at TU Wien,Robert Horvath,"IoTSyS uses oBIX (Open Building Information Exchange), an open standard for information exchange in building automation.It provides a generic object model and defines ways to read, write and invoke operations on objects. oBIX also provides certain services, like watch, history and alarm services.The current implementation is incomplete and only implements parts of the watch and history services.In this project, I am going to fully implement the latest oBIX 1.1 Specification Working Draft."
Eclipse Array Explorer Improvement,Computational Science and Engineering at TU Wien,J.T. James,"The Eclipse Array Explorer developed by CVAST at TU Wien University is a powerful tool created to make visualizing arrays and collections in the Eclipse Debugging framework easy. The explorer gives several options to replace the standard Eclipse framework. In its current state, the plug-in is powerful, but it needs to be updated in order to allow for widespread usage and adoption of the plugin by the Eclipse community. I feel that this plugin can easily be updated to become an even more powerful tool able to handle large arrays, collections, and maps. "
GDAL/OGR: Rigorous Support of Vertical Datums within OGRSpatialReference,Computational Science and Engineering at TU Wien,Peb Aryan,"GDAL/OGR is widely used geospatial data abstraction library. 3D spatial data mainly consists of surface location and height. While surface location consider geometrical aspect of the Earth, height is modeled differently due to gravity.Although at some extent vertical coordinate transformation is supported by GDAL/OGR , the transformation chain did not compensate for height information. This project will establish a rigorous 3D transformation chain to support vertical datum."
Integrating ViennaCL into the Python scientific ecosystem,Computational Science and Engineering at TU Wien, Smithe,"PyViennaCL will provide Python bindings for ViennaCL along with documentation and regression tests.

OpenEngSB: Query transformation for multiple tool models based on Common Concept Model,Computational Science and Engineering at TU Wien,Fajar J. Ekaputra,"OpenEngSB provides an easy-to-use and easy-to-adapt platform for tool integration. There are two issues to be solved in the current OpenEngSB query transformation. The first issue is to let the users of OpenEngSB easily define and execute query for different data sources. The other issue is regarding the unfamiliarity of users with the SPARQL for ontology querying, as the current implementation of OpenEngSB is using ontology for storing their data. Other issue that is also related but will be addressed as optional is the querying of several different ontology versions. The aim of this project is to provide an implementation of SQL query user interface, transform it into SPARQL queries, and get the combined result data from heterogeneous ontology data sources for OpenEngSB"

To this end various compression algorithms have already been implemented. I intend to enrich this collection of algorithms to produce even shorter proofs while remaining in a reasonable computation time window. I would like to implement three new algorithms. Those are Subsumption, RecycleUnits and a variation of the already implemented RecyclePivots algorithm. The first two are described in the literature, but both also leave room for improvement. While I intend to generalize RecycleUnits, Subsumption needs some adaption in order to have the required efficiency."

A cluster of these SUTs connect to a concentrator computer based on Raspberry Pi (RasPi) board where it provides functions of flashing, controlling and monitoring of the SUTs. A large number of such clusters may exist which could be connected to a common LAN or the internet so that these concentrators can be accessed remotely from any computer via SSH and an individual SUT may then be controlled through the software within the concentrator.Programmable USB Power-strips are provided such that individual switches can be programmed by the test server to control power to the SUTs and other peripherals."
Creative Commons Pasteboard,Creative Commons,Thanish,The Creative Commons Pasteboard is a browser extension used to help users easily clip content from different sources around the web. It also helps users by automatically adding attribution information when users paste their clips into documents.
Proposal - Media Fingerprint Library,Creative Commons,Ethan Lim,"CCMF is intended to safeguard copyright owner's intellectual properties, by keeping track of the appearance of their content on the web. Eventually, CCMF would notify these owners if their copyright of their content has been violated on the web.To facilitate this, CCMF would require a signature of author's original content. Subsequently, various search channels would compare with this signature. When the search channels chance upon a significantly similar web content, CCMF would verify that it belongs to the original content and identify it's author.Another key idea is that the all computations can be accomplished via the client's browser or via the Node.JS environment. There is no centralised server requirement to use this library."
Convert Gene Wiki Bot to write to Wikidata,Crowdsourcing Biology at the Scripps Research Institute,Chinmay Naik,"Pygenewiki(Gene Wiki Bot) automatically creates/updates ProteinBox Templates which form the infoboxes of gene wiki articles. It retrieves information about genes from databases (such as NCBI, HUGO etc),populates the ProteinBox Templates with this gene information which are then inserted into gene Wiki articles. Wikidata is free knowledge database aimed to provide structured data easily accessible to anyone. The new proposed bot would capture particular gene information onto a wikidata item andmap it to the corresponding gene article. This will help to create structured data about genes in an easily accessible database. Also, other aspects about a gene such as its relationship with other genes, diseases etc can also be captured."

Enabling free multimedia real-time communications (RTC) with Debian,Debian Project,Catalin Constantin Usurelu,"Currently Debian contains various applications for RTC, but there are problems when trying to make them work together. There are issues with NAT traversal, especially symmetrical NAT's and, of course, there is the problem of inter-program communication, there are various incompatibilities when trying to communicate between different types of clients. ICE/TURN/STUN are capable of traversing NAT/firewalls but the multitude of programs, protocols and fragmentation in general, will always pose problems. WebRTC promises to fix these problems and it has the potential to become the de facto standard in real time communication."

The second part is to write tools to ease the packaging of software made with Leiningen and Clojure.
MIPS N32/N64 ABI Port,Debian Project,Eleanor Chen,"MIPS is one of the most elegant RISC CPUs in the industry, and there are quite a lot different usages in its family. This project attempts to create a new MIPS N32/N64 ABI port for Debian. Different from O32 (used by existing mips/mipsel port), N32 is an address model that has most 64-bit capabilities but uses 32-bit data structures to save space and process time, it is quite similar to the ongoing x32 port for x86 platform. At the same time, N64 is a full 64-bit address model which is comparable to x86_64 on x86. There is consensus that N32/N64 ABI would give capable devices better performance, while O32 ABI should be kept for devices that is only 32-bit capable. Since Multiarch support is almost available in Debian, we are able to apply the state-of-art technology to help us on both bootstrapping and future usages. Users can run N64 kernel with mixed N32/N64 userland to take advantage of both the performance and the large memory as needed."

PTS rewrite in Django,Debian Project,Marko Lalic,"Package Tracking System (PTS) is currently a mess of various technologies and languages: Perl, Python, XSLT which makes it extremely hard to maintain and extend. It includes an e-mail and Web interface for viewing information about packages, but the information shown is rather fixed and adding something new is a daunting task. Finally, since it is based on generating static HTML files, it does not offer real-time up-to-date information. This project aims to rewrite the application using Python and the Django framework in order to solve these problems by making a modular modern Django application."
Redesign metapackage creation for Debian Blends,Debian Project,Emmanouil Kiagias,"In Debian Blends a basic way to install packages belonging to a certain user task is a set of so called metapackages. The package blends-dev is responsible for creating these metapackages taking as input data task files, which specify dependecies from binary packages. The current implementation is using information from the system where blends-dev is called to validate the dependencies. In practice this has the effect that the most popular architectures (i386, amd64) are used as reference for metapackages which are intended to work on all available Debian architectures. The task of the GSoC project is to rewrite the blends-dev code to enable architecture dependent metapackages creation."
scan-build on the Debian archive,Debian Project,Léo Cavaillé,"The project consists in using clang's static analyzer (C, C++, Objective-C) on Debian packages to help developers find bugs that compilers are not able to find. scan-build can detect a large range of oddities in the code from dead assignments (a clean up is always something worthy) to null pointer dereferencement or weird malloc/free scenarios. This is a process that could be integrated into Debian quality assurance workflow, to ensure stability for end users and remove bugs even before uploading packages to the archive (such as other daca tools or lintian checks)."
ZFS on Linux integration,Debian Project,Aron Xu,"ZFS provides many more advanced features than any other filesystems available to Linux users, and it's proven in production environment for years. There is btrfs under heavy development to provide similar functions, while the way is still quite long to go. At the same time native ZFS on Linux (ZoL) is a low hanging fruit for Linux users. To achieve this target we have two things to do: make zfs actually work on a Linux distribution; make it better integrated into the system, pushing its higher-level functions more handy to end users. This project covers the both parts, which is to provide a functional ZFS support in Debian by integrating basic functions into the system and more in-depth integration. A well integrated ZFS support will make Debian even better suited for enterprise usages than today, and most of the work in this project will be immediately available to BTRFS users once different bits are taken care."

Customized XML to JSON& JSON to XML Conversion Utility,"Dept. of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University",Nakull Gupta,"The main aim of the project is to design and implement a library to allow conversion of XML data sets to JSON in a custom defined manner - with the help of user defined mappings. Round trip conversion - XML -> JSON -> XML will also be supported.The use case is that currently all the open source tools which perform this conversion do not allow mapping specific attributes and nodes. They transform the complete XML into a JSON without taking into consideration user specifications. In most cases only a small portion of the XML is required to be transformed( to specific JSON fields) - which can be easily specified by XPath and JSON Schema - thus the requirement of this utility. The library designed will be easy to use and have an extensible and simple Interface. The mappings file will be a JSON Schema file with the description tag for each element containing the XPath expression for the same. Only those elements which are required to be converted from XML will be specified by the user in the JSON Schema.Some limitations might arise as with just XPath and JSON Schema there might be ambiguities and anomalies in the conversion. I will be documenting all these and trying to rectify and reduce the limitations of this library. I have expanded more on the features of this library in the course of this proposal."

Parallelization and Automation of Drizzle Continuous Integration Infrastructure,Drizzle Database,Sharan Kumar M,"Drizzle Continuous Integration uses Jenkins CI tool at present. It includes a Jenkins server / master with a few slaves. However, the infrastructure does not support parallel running of tests / builds to a scalable extend. So the project aims in bringing parallelism with automation. This can be envisioned as follows. Drizzle CI does builds using Jenkins. It tests for regression using the available test suites. To bring in parallelism, the CI infrastructure should make execution of test jobs, which may include a build, a sysbench test, a randgen test, etc., simultaneous. A dedicated system / cloud node must be configured for execution of each job in the test job list. Multiple tests + Multiple nodes = Parallelism. Configuring these nodes should be handled in a simple way. It should be as simple as writing a simple config file, of specified format, and then issuing a command which configures the nodes accordingly. Nodes + Configuration files = Automated configuration."
A new trait implementation,ESUG (European Smalltalk User Group),Sebastian Tleye,"Traits are pure units of behavior that can be composed to form classes or other traits. The trait composition mechanism is an alternative to multiple or mixin inheritance in which the composer has full control over the trait composition. The result enables more reuse than single inheritance without introducing the drawbacks of multiple or mixin inheritance.The current implementation of traits in Pharo merges the trait methods into the classes that use the trait. This merging of external methods into classes makes the implementation of the development tools harder.So, the idea would be improve this implementation."

Debugger Improvements,ESUG (European Smalltalk User Group),Clara Allende,"The Smalltalk IDE contains an advanced debugger that allows the programmer to explore and change the program as it is executing.Over the last years, the Smalltalk community has realized a number of experiments and libraries that, taken together, form a powerful core of a new, even more advance debugger subsystem:a new Debugger Modela first graphical user interface for this modelan AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) interpreterresearch in the direction of Object Centric DebuggingThe goal of this internship is to take the exiting code and build a new debugger infrastructure.Technical DetailsTo solve this problem, the student will have to:implement a user interface using the Spec frameworkextend the AST Interpreter to support debugging (e.g., single step execution)extend the debugger model to use the AST interpreterintegrate with Object Centric DebuggingBenefits to the Studentlearn about Abstract Syntax Trees, Debuggers and IDEs.learn about advanced concepts of language implementation.learn about design and implementation of debuggers for dynamic languagesunderstand how programming languages and IDEs are implemented;integration into a prolific community, fond of software development and programming languages;potential integration as a master and/or PhD student within research groups of the community around the world (France, Switzerland, Chile, Belgium, Argentina).Benefits to the CommunityFor the Smalltalk community, the current debugger is an indispensable tool for daily development. An improved debugger will have a direct impact on the productivity of every developer and will, last but not least, support the development of Smalltalk IDEs themselves."
Graph-ET,ESUG (European Smalltalk User Group),Daniel Aviv,"The necessity of having a chart-drawing tool integrated with Roassal is increasing day by day. Graph-ET is a tool that allows the user to create and draw charts with small and expressive Smalltalk instructions. The user may enter a large variety of entries, and the program with parse it to fit the users need. For example, the user may use a domain of words and visualize the length of those words with just two lines of code. The nice thing about Graph-ET is that it’s very simple to see results also the interface allows the user the play with their charts in avariety of ways. The idea is having a kind of EyeSee but with Roassal as rendering and adding more power of desition to the user.Graph-ET is a software that needs to draw to work, for that it mainly uses Object Profile’s Roassal to make the drawing and the interaction work.The student will learn a lot more of Smalltalk and Pharo environment. Also he will learn some chart visualization and learn to solve all the problems that come with it. Not to mention learning entry parsing. Mainly he will face with serious and critical decisions that will change the fate of his program, but that will mean significant learning process for him.The community will have the pleasure of making fast charts with small and expressive instructions; this will lead to a more simple way of making and drawing charts. The users of Roassal will enjoy a tool that fit their needs and that work well with the software they already own."

Mars 1.0,ESUG (European Smalltalk User Group),Carla Griggio,"Current Pharo UI state of the art building is tightly coupled to the Morphic framework. Morphic, though flexible, has became aged and far from the experience a native interface can offer. Mars is cross-platform native user interface framework, which allows Pharo programmers to build modern user experiences. Mars currently is under heavy changes due to a big refactoring performed to allow multi-platform behavior, and most of its widgets need to be rebuilt, thought not entirely from scratch."

AHCI device model in userspace for bhyve,FreeBSD,Zhixiang Yu,"Currently bhyve only supports virtio disk for the guest's block device. This project will add AHCI device emulation to bhyve so that we can emulate normal cdroms and disks. This project will benefit bhyve a lot. First of all, since AHCI is widely supported in various Operating Systems, bhyve can support other nonproprietary and proprietary guest OSs without the virtio disk driver in those OSs. Secondly, this project will make it possible to install a GENERIC system from a emulated cdrom device."

Currently pkgng uses its own solver, however, it misses important features, such as alternatives logic, advanced conﬂict resolving and provide/require logic. Furthermore, there are numerous researches related to solver algorithms and pkgng should provide pluggable interface for such solvers and eventually select an optimal one. So the main goal of this project is to design and implement pluggable API for pkgng solverthat allows to use experimental solvers with fallback to default solver if there are no external solvers"

Android support for darknet connections ,Freenet Project Inc,Nitesh Bharadwaj,"A P2P platform like freenet should definitely have an Android version. Since it is a resource intensive application, it might consume a lot of battery/data. My objective is to utilize the technologies, pre-built into android (Wi-Fi direct and QR), to save upon battery/data and to make it user friendly where ever possible. The power problem is overcome by making two versions of the application, a resource intensive and a light weight. The resource intensive application runs on laptops,homeservers etc. while light weight application on android mobiles. These two applications communicate with each other over Wi-Fi direct (i.e. no data/internet connectivity is required).We plan to use QR code as a means to establish darknet connections. Two nodes connect when they scan each other's QR codes. This provides a very user friendly and secure alternative to run darknet in a censored environment.Finally, we plan to utilize Wi-Fi direct for exchanging popular content on the data stores when two nodes meet. This lessens the burden on actual internet connectivityWith smart phones, smart cameras and smart TV sets evolving. this project appears rewarding."
Distributed Version Control Improvements with WoT and Infocalypse,Freenet Project Inc,Steve Dougherty,"Source repositories in Freenet are somewhat inconvenient, requiring manual sharing of repository keys, and having no features apart from push and pull. I'd like to extend Infocalypse to use WoT to make it easier to push, pull, and discuss code. This means the ability to publish repositories under WoT identities, and allowing others to make comments and pull requests. In a phrase, I hope to build a distributed GitHub over Freenet."
File sharing/searching for Freenet,Freenet Project Inc,leuchtkaefer,My “ideal storage system” includes functionality to share and search for immutable documents (such songs or videos). The search results include objects that were generated in the system that contain partial data of the targeted file. These objects were generated independently of the initial user’s uploaded file. Later the user or someone who is searching for this content can use the new objects to recover the initial file. To make this thing possible it is necessary to locate these new objects. The search is conducted using CHK without any extra knowledge.

External peripherals and high bandwidth probe support,Funf.org,Pararth Shah,"My proposed idea for Funf.org is a combination of two ideas: (i) to build a framework for supporting probes to collect data from external peripheral devices, and (ii) to support high bandwidth probes, eg. photo, video and audio probes.Although both ideas cannot be implemented in 3 months, I am looking forward to being assigned either one of the two projects, or a combination of the two. (See full proposal for details.)Both of the ideas excite me, as they will provide a platform for accessing, storing, processing and uploading a range of data formats, from a variety of input devices/sensors. This will increase the reach of the Funf framework and enable a lot of interesting applications to built upon this platform."
Allocate or rebalance VMs based on CPU load metrics,Ganeti,Spyros Trigazis,"It has been observed that when running relatively big Ganeti clusters with lots of VMs on them, the major problem when allocating (or rebalancing) is the CPU load. Only the number of CPUs of every node is being taken in account at the moment which results to imbalanced nodes. The proposed idea is to also take in account a metric for each node’s CPU load in a time window t, export this information for every node to hail and then choose to allocate with a corresponding policy."

Optimizing large applications with LTO,GCC - GNU Compiler Collection,Martin Liška,"Link time optimization (LTO) in GCC has become mature enough to build large applications like Firefox, Chromium or Linux kernel. The optimization offers a great opportunity for additional performance improvements different from program speed or memory consumption. Large applications are motivated to reduce size of executable, either because of mobile platforms (i.e. Firefox for Android), or due to dynamic linker boot load steps such as dynamic relocations or static initializers. I will benchmark large applications from the point of view described above and I will implement LTO IPA passes that will deal with described issues."

Working in a close collaboration with the GNOME Design Team the main goal of this project is on one side to improve gnome-clocks world view by implementing the support for custom city images as well as the integration with geolocation and on the another side to use a framework of gnome-clocks App to test and to implement new design ideas.
Modular encryption support,GNOME,Sam Bull,"My project is to integrate modular encryption into the GNOME desktop. This is partly in response to the security and privacy fundraiser currently going on. I believe this would solve one part of the puzzle, by allowing users to securely store documents in a way that doesn't interfere with the user experience.In order to not interfere with the user experience, it should not require a login (ruling out disk/home encryption) and should not require doing anything different once encrypted (ruling out 3rd-party software with poor UX).To achieve this, I am using a Nautilus extension that allows the user to encrypt a folder from the context menu. To access the decrypted contents, the user only has to open the folder, and it will be decrypted on the fly. The only difference in user experience is asking to unlock the keyring (if it's still locked) when opening one of these folders.I am proposing for this project, to integrate this into GNOME directly, and in the process fix up some rough edges."
Overhaul the Date & Time panel in System Settings,GNOME,Kalev Lember,"This project is about implementing a new Date & Time panel design for the GNOME System Settings.The streamlined user experience is going to cover manually setting date and time; using the NTP for automatic time syncronization; setting the time zone; and automatically updating the timezone based on geolocation data."

n-point image deformation,GNU Image Manipulation Program,Marek Dvorožňák,"During image editing it's very useful to have a possibility to deform an image in a way so that it behaves like a real world object (or object made of a rubber). At present there are many image deformation methods allowing us to do that. Some of them are implemented as tools in various software - for example Puppet Warp in Photoshop. I propose to implement a method into GIMP which behaves similarly to these methods but is more intuitive (easier to use), more predictable and should be fast enough."

[GNU Classpath] New Gtk3 Look and Feel for OpenJDK,GNU Project,Elisa,"OpenJDK support a Look and Feel implementation based on GTK+, but uses API found only in an older, obsoleted version of GTK+ and not in the latest version GTK+ 3. This represents a problem in a number of ways. First of all, most modern GNU/Linux distributions now use GTK+ 3 which has a different theming mechanism whichis not compatible and hence cannot be used with GTK+ 2. This project aims to port the native look and feel from GTK+ 2 to GTK+ 3, solving most of the above issues."
[GNU Classpath] Port the GTK+ AWT support for GTK+ 3,GNU Project,Farshad Muhammad,"GTK (GIMP Toolkit) is an open source toolkit for Linux and Unix systems for GUI production and is used by many java applications. The GNU Classpath at the moment ships with a GTK+2 peer which provides most of its GUI support, which is unfortunately outdated as most GNU/Linux distributions are packaged and shipped with GTK+3. Thus this project aims to prepare and port the GTK+ peer to work and build with GTK+ 3 providing and ideally allowing for the uses of the new GTK+3 features with GNU Classpath. The porting process will be conducted following a guide provided by GTK+. The porting process should also be done in such a manner as to make the classpath backwards compatible with GTK+ 2, this is to avoid future problems, if any occur with the usage of GTK+ 3."
[HURD] Improve the GDB Port for GNU Hurd,GNU Project,hacklu,"Many cases show that the GDB on GNU Hurd is not so good as on GNU/Linux in terms of functionality and integrity.The former eagerly needto improve the porting such as fixingthe bug and make up the defect of missing important component like gdbserver. Gdbserver makes it possible to remotely debug. Without the porting of gdbserver, the porting of GDB to GNU Hurd is incomplete."

GNU Radio FPGA Co-processing with the Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip,GNU Radio,Jonathon Pendlum,"Many signal processing blocks in GNU Radio exhibit parallelism and can be efficiently mapped to the architecture of a FPGA. However, GNU Radio has been slow to adopt FPGA hardware acceleration, likely due to a lack of suitable hardware and difficulty of HDL design. Recently, FPGA vendor Xilinx released the Zynq, a System-on-Chip (SoC) that tightly couples programmable logic with a dual core Cortex A9 ARM processor. It features low latency, high throughput, and cache-coherent communication between the programmable logic and the ARM processor cores. Due to this feature, the Zynq SoC has gained interest in the GNU Radio community as a viable platform for FPGA hardware co-processing. This project proposes adding a framework to GNU Radio to support FPGA co-processing with Xilinx's Zynq SoC."

Extending GHC to support building modules in parallel,haskell.org,Patrick Palka,"The aim of this project is to implement native support for building modules in parallel in GHC. This entails making the compilation pipeline thread-safe, and writing a parallel compilation driver next to the existing sequential driver. Focus will be placed on correctness and deterministic output, with speed a latent concern. Nothing in the user's end should change other than there being a new ""-j"" flag that specifies the number of modules to build in parallel. The cabal-install project should be augmented with the ability to use this new -j flag to speed up builds, alongside its existing package-level parallelization."

Port Charts to use Diagrams,haskell.org,jbracker,"Right now the Charts library uses Cairo as backend. Cairo can be difficult to build on platforms other then Linux. Goal of the project would be to port the Charts library to be independent of the used backend. Like that it can support to use Diagrams as backend. Diagrams supports a variety of backends (SVG, Postscript, Cairo (Optional!), Tikz, Gtk), some of which are written platform indepent. As Diagrams is easy to install on every platform supported by Haskell, so will the Charts Library built upon Diagrams. This will make it easy for Haskellers to add charting capabilities to their own applications and libraries in a manner portable across all platforms without any pain."

As the result they are widely used in developing countries, where dhis2 is used as well. So I think dhis2 Android client should be implemented in the first order.First of all, Android application of dhis2 should support variety of OS versions (beginning from 2.2 – Gingerbread ending with 4.X - Jellybean) because a lot of devices still didn’t get update to new Android 4.X (maybe will not at all). This app should be simple and straightforward, so I want it to be in HOLO style. And of course it should be multi-lingual. I’m planning to implement core of application before first deadline (POSTing and GETting data from server, reporting ability, offline mode). After mid-term I want to add Geolocation support , implement Tablet interface and make application multilingual."

BrianDROID - Neural simulation on mobile devices,International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility,Achilleas,"Brian is a simulator for spiking neural networks, written in Python. The 2.0 version (currently in development) uses a hybrid programming language approach: The models and the simulation script are written in Python but the code in each simulation timestep is executed in generated code (for example in C++). Mobile devices such as Android phones have powerful processing units and versatile sensors, making them useful as a ""brain"" in robotics applications. Being able to run a Brian script on an Android phone would therefore be a useful testbed for neural models in a ""real life"" setting. The aims of this project are the following:- Write a conversion tool to convert a Brian simulation to a standalone Java program that runs on Android (making use of Brian's existing code generation facilities).- Add features to Brian that allow real-time simulation (e.g. dynamically adapt the simulation time step if the simulation is running too slow)- Access the phone's sensors (e.g. the microphone) and use them in the simulation in real time.The end result should be code with the above functionality and a working prototype for a neural model running on Android (for example, the so-called Licklider model of pitch recognition, using the phone's microphone as input). The student working on this project needs to have access to an Android phone."

Several other data platforms are available, including the data management system developed at the German Neuroinformatics Node, which provides direct access to neuroscience data via a well-defined API. The aim of this project is to develop a client application that allows Dataspace users to search and access data at the G-Node, thus integrating available G-Node neuroscience data into the Dataspace federation."
"Open source, cross simulator, models of cortical circuits.",International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility,Vitor Chaud,"An increasing number of studies are using large scale network models incorporating realistic connectivity to understand information processing in cortical structures. High performance computational resources are becoming more widely available to computational neuroscientists for this type of modeling and general purpose, well tested simulation environments such as NEURON and NEST are widely used. In addition, hardware solutions (based on custom neuromorphic hardware or off the shelf FPGA/GPU hardware) are in development, promising ever larger, faster simulations.However, there is a lack of well tested, community maintained network model examples which can work across all of these simulation solutions, which both incorporate realistic cell and network properties and provide networks of sufficient complexity to test the performance and scalability of these platforms. This work will involve converting a number of published cortical network models into open, simulator independent formats such as PyNN (http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/), NeuroML (http://www.neuroml.org/) and NineML (http://software.incf.org/software/nineml), testing them across multiple simulator implementations and making them available to the community through the Open Source Brain repository (http://www.opensourcebrain.org/).

Augmented Reality Application for Interactive Flood Simulation,Iowa Flood Center,Keng Siang Lee,"The aim of this project is to create a web-based augmented reality application using HTML5 technologies for an interactive flood simulation. Users will place encoded paper markers on a board, each representing an object such as a house, car, bridge, levee, dam etc. A webcam is then used to detect and track these markers in real-time. 3D virtual objects will be overlaid on these markers on the screen. A height-map terrain can be loaded by the user to represent the actual terrain condition of a specific place and to provide more interesting structures for flooding to occur. Additional sculpting of the terrain is possible using special “sculpting markers” which can either bump or dent a terrain area. A rainfall event can then be initiated which will flood the area according to variables such as rainfall amount, drainage rate and evaporation rate. Other sources of water can be created by the user using markers which represent water sources, or by removing water-holding structures such as levees or dams. The flood simulation will interact with the 3D virtual objects in the scene."

Enhancing Giri: Dynamic Slicing in LLVM,LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,Mingliang LIU,"Dynamic program slicing has been used in many applications. Giri was a re- search project from UIUC, which im- plemented the dynamic backward slicing in LLVM. I think it’s a good idea to extend this project in several ways: 1) Update the code to LLVM mainline and make it robust, 2) Improve the performance of giri run-time, 3) Reduce the trace size, etc."
FastPolly: Reducing LLVM-Polly Compile-Time Overhead,LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,Star Tan,"LLVM-Polly is a promising polyhedral optimizer for data-locality and parallelism. However, experimental results show that Polly analysis and optimization can lead to significant compile-time overhead. On average, Polly optimization will increase the compile time by 393% for PolyBench benchmarks and by 53% for MediaBench benchmarks. That means if you want to gain from Polly, you have to pay 4 times extra compile-time overhead. Even if you do not want to gain much from Polly, you still have to pay 53% compile-time overhead. Such expensive compile-time overhead would make Polly much less attractive to LLVM users. I argue that maintaining fast compile time when Polly is enabled is very important, especially if we think of enabling Polly in default for all LLVM users. Based on this assumption, this project tries to reduce Polly compile-time overhead by revising a large number of Polly passes. First, I will revising some hot Polly passes that dominate the total compile-time overhead; Second, I will revisit Polly canonicalization passes and try to let the Polly bail out early, so Polly will not cause much overhead when it cannot optimize program; Third, I will revisit and improve Polly optimization passes and code generation passes, so Polly can be much faster when it can optimize program. I hope this project can benefit both LLVM users and Polly users. For LLVM users who care more about compile-time overhead, it enables Polly to provide extra performance gains within little extra compile-time overhead. For Polly users who care more about code quality, this project will significantly reduce the compile-time overhead without performance loss."

New decoding error-correcting codes algorithm for Sage,lmonade: scientific software distribution,Veronica Suaste,"In recent years complexity of decoding linear codes has been one of the most important research topics about linear codes. This problem is known to be NP-hard with arbitrary codes and trying to decode arbitrarily many errors. Nevertheless there is better results that one can apply to specific classes of codes when the number of errors is limited.In this project we present a new decoding algorithm for linear codes over finite fields. This algorithm is based on the computation ofthe Gröbner basis of the ideal associated to the linear code.One of the tools we use is the free open-source mathematics software SAGE.The main goal of this work is the implementation of the algorithm in order to make a contribution to SAGE in the linear codes area. Also wemake a comparison between the new algorithm and the ones already implemented in SAGE and GUAVA, expecting a improvement in the efficiency of the decoding problem."

Horizontal scrollbar for tables and math for LyX,LyX – The Document Processor,Hashini Senaratne,"LyX Document processor provides users with an excellent UI for creating and editing LaTeX tables and math. One drawback of the current implementation is that when a table or math equation is too wide so as not to fit on the screen, the right-hand edge will ""disappear"" outside the screen limits. This makes editing wider tables and equations more difficult, and sometimes requires users to decrease the font size in LyX to be able to see the full table/equation on the screen. It is needed some sort of a way like a horizontal scroll bar to access the parts of the document, beyond the screen limits."

The first step is to instrument the code generated by the baseline compiler to profile branches which are executed. Then use this information to reduce and improve IonMonkey's compilation by filtering out branches which are infrequently used."
Implementation of Profile in the Cloud (PiCl) Client for Firefox OS,Mozilla,Akshay Katyal,My proposal aims to integrate Firefox OS sync service into the current PiCl implementation. The idea is to extend the PiCl back-end to support Firefox OS and develop a minimal Firefox OS client to demonstrate the actual sync process. Current proposal covers syncing of contacts which can later be extended to settings and related things as well.
Improving text selection and rotation in PDF.js,Mozilla,Srishti ,"PDF.js component has been recently integrated into the Firefox browser. Where earlier rendering a pdf document required a third party software like Adobe Acrobat reader, this component brings a standard platform to parse and render PDF files within the web browser. The current proposal aims to improve the text layer in PDF.js. Some of the functionalities in the text layer is broken such as the improper behaviour of PDF.js during text selection, insertion of an extra ‘newline’ character in between the text when it is copy-pasted from PDF.js, rotation of pdf documents and highlighting of wrong text when searched using ‘find’. The project also involves improving text layer formatting like adding font styles italics, bold, h1 and height/width of the text in the document."
Instantbird Awesometab,Mozilla,Nihanth Subramanya,"I propose to develop a ""smart"" user interface, in the form of a user-openable tab, that allows the user to quickly and efficiently open new chats - based on who they chat with most often, and on what accounts they do so.The user should be able to go from actively chatting in one conversation to doing so in a new one, losing no time in finding the contact to start the conversation with, refocusing to the correct UI element, or opening extra windows."

Make Firefox Developer Tools compatible to Thunderbird,Mozilla,Philipp Kewisch,"I propose to modify Thunderbird to allow using all current remote features of the Mozilla Developer Tools. This includes the web console, debugger, style editor and network monitor. The key difference between my proposal and the past solutions is that no extra UI is needed within Thunderbird which might end up breaking because Firefox-specific features are being used. Instead, I will ensure the existing components are fully free of Firefox specific code and write the wrapper layer needed to make use of the backend components."

Rust Debug Symbol Generation,Mozilla,Michael Woerister,"The compiler for Rust, Mozilla's new programming language, does not yet fully support creating valid debug symbols. *rustc* uses LLVM as code generator and LLVM also supports creating debug symbols, provided that the LLVM IR it uses as input contains correct metadata annotations about variables, functions, types, etc. This metadata is very similar to the DWARF debug symbol format.*rustc* already provides some of this metadata generation in librustc/middle/trans/debuginfo.rs. The goal of this GSoC project is to implement the missing functionality so that in September rustc can be debugged itself using gdb (see *Schedule of Deliverables* for details on what tasks this involves specifically)."

Improved MIDI import for MuseScore notation program,MuseScore,Andrey M. Tokarev,The project goal is to improve MIDI import in MuseScore by implementation of several different features that will be useful for conversion MIDI files to music notation. It is important possibility to import MIDI files recorded with other software. There is no one-to-one conversion from MIDI to music notation in general but the conversion process can be made more accurate. I hope this project will help to improve MIDI import operations in MuseScore and make user work with the program more effective.

Codon Alignment and Analysis in Biopython,National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent),Zheng Ruan,A codon alignment is an alignment of nucleotide sequences in which trinucleotides correspond directly to amino acids in translated product. Codon alignment is useful as it distinguished different types of nucleotides substitution and is frequently used to test neutrality and calculate selection pressure. My job in the project is to develop codon alignment support for biopython. This will facilitate quick and large scale evolutionary analysis in biopython environment.
Extend PartitionFinder to automatically partition DNA and protein alignments.,National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent),Paul Frandsen,"ParitionFinder is a piece of phylogenetics software that combines similar sets of sites in a DNA or amino acid alignment into a partitioning scheme. The advantage of using a partitioning scheme is that each subset of sites can be independently modeled, which can have a substantial impact on the results of a phylogenetic analysis. PartitionFinder currently requires that the user predefine subsets (they often choose to do so by gene or codon position). Such assignments can often be arbitrary and may not result in the best fit model. This is especially true for alignments that include several different types of data (ultra conserved elements, introns, etc.), which are becoming increasingly common. This project will expand the utility of the software by implementing a new algorithm to automatically split either user defined subsets or entire alignments into one or more new subsets using site-specific substitution rates. This new functionality will result in partitioning schemes designed to closely reflect biological processes."
Identifying problems with gene predictions,National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent),Monica-Andreea Dragan,"Genome sequencing is now possible at almost no cost.

A number of customizations could be implemented, including layout algorithm to consider things like substrates and products of process nodes on opposite sides and tiling of members properly inside a molecular complex. This work would improve the SBGN-ML support in BioPAX-Paxtools[4] as well as improving the layout in the network view of cBio Cancer Genomics portal [7]. Besides the improvements on BioPAX-Paxtools[4] and cBioPortal[7], more general hope for the project is providing a common usable asset for the tools that supports SBGN Process Description language."
Idea 26: CentiScaPe Development and addition of extra Centrality parameter called Eigenvector Centrality.,National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Shaik Faizaan,"CentiScaPe is a Cytoscape App that allows computing network centrality parameters. It calculates Degree, Average Shortest Path, Eccentricity, Closeness, Betweenness, Centroid, Stress and Radiality. It allows the user to analyze existing relationships between experimental data provided by the users and node centrality values computed by the App. While CentiScaPe provides a number of useful capabilities it could be significantly improved with two or more of additions or enhancements. My project will add the following to CentiScaPe:1.Add support for directed networks. Current support for only undirected networks limits the sophistication and interpretability of centrality calculations.2.Add support for integrating experimental data into the topological analysis to be used as weights in the calculations.3.Add an Extra Centrality parameter called Eigenvector Centrality, which is one among the centralities in graph theory.4.Allow plugin to pass parameters and network to an existing web service version of the CentiScaPe computation to improve performance for large networks.This will enrich experimental data with network topological parameters even for directed, weighted and large networks. project proposal - http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/faizaan/1"
Idea 27: Modeling and Visualizing Cell Signaling Networks with SigViz,National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Ritisha ,"Software tools like cytoscape can represent biological data in the form of network graphs with nodes, edges, and attributes. These attributes are the static properties of the nodes and edges (components). Using them, we can easily visualize and segregate components using clustering, paths etc. However, in some fields, like cell signaling, the attributes of the nodes and edges should not be static. They change over time and with dependencies on one another. In such cases, the amount of data becomes huge and such multi-state representations, if done statically, become cumbersome and non-intuitive."
Idea 31 : Visualization of Dynamic Graphs in Cytoscape,National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Jimmy,"DynNetwork is an OSGi bundle developed by Sabina Sara Pfister as a 2012 GSOC project to provide support for importing, visualizing, and analysing dynamical networks in Cytoscape 3.0. This project would be an extension of the DynNetwork project. While DynNetwork allows dynamic networks to be imported from XGMML files, support for importing dynamic networks from spreadsheets would be a great addition. On the visualization side I feel the fish-eye lens would be a really cool feature to add. In addition to the above two features, I intend to implement the following features which would help the researchers greatly to analyse the networks: a) Graph metrics such as in-degree, out-degree, etc displayed graphically against time b) Dynamic attributes of a node/edge displayed as a timeseries graph."

Implementation of Fuzzy Clusters in Cytoscape,National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Abhiraj Tomar,"Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects, based on their similarity with other members of the group (cluster). In hard clustering, data is divided into distinct clusters, where each data element belongs to exactly one cluster.But in real applications, there is very often no sharp boundary between clusters, which makes it difficult to discretely assign objects to distinct clusters. Such scenarios require fuzzy clustering, which allows objects to belong to several clusters simultaneously, with different degrees of membership. The project deals with implementation of fuzzy clusters in cytoscape and their visualization. "

Gsoc 2013 Proposal : System clock startup analysis,Network Time Foundation,Rahul Katare,"Ntpd program is an operating system daemon which sets and maintains system time of the day in synchronism with internet standard time servers. It operates by exchanging one or more messages with one or more configured servers at designated poll intervals. Ntpd currently applies small corrections (-500, 0 or 500 ppm discrete corrections) to the system time every second. If ntpd uses adjtime(), it updates the system clock every second. But some clock implementations do not provide small update to system clock. So there is a clock model which provides a kernel discipline called ntp_adjtime() which is used by Ntpd to adjust several parameters of the clock. References : http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-algo.htm and http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-algo-kernel.htm. There are two aspects to time corrections, applying an offset and adjusting the clock-frequency.The idea here is to perform a startup analysis of the time offset and the frequency correction that needs to be applied. The objective is to, first collect the data from N servers, using that calculate the offset and frequency adjustment that needs to be done."
Improve ./scripts directory in NTP distribution,Network Time Foundation,Oliver Kindernay,"NTP distribution contains ./scripts/ directory along with ntp daemon and client software. This directory stores small scripts that proved useful when managing, monitoring or developing ntp suite. Quick search reveals that this directory contains approximately 50 scripts written in perl, shell and awk. Some of these scripts are outdated and broken or using deprecated tools. The goals of the project are to review the whole ./scripts/ directory, fix broken scripts where it makes sense, improve existing scripts by improving perl codebase using modern perl practices (mainly usage of strict pragma), adding new features and standardizing command line arguments. The output of the project will also be documentation for each script. I will be also dealing with writing tag translators between multiple documentation formats (texi, mdoc, man, .info and html) which ntp uses for documentation. Another goal of the project is to establish a testing framework for test automation on various platforms for scripts directory."

New Timestamp Format and API,Network Time Foundation,Chen Li,"There are different timescales being used everywhere, like UTC and GPS. When user application gets timestamp from system, it can’t tell which timescale the system is using. What’s more, the timestamp being used may step backward in cases such as system time is set manually, which could be disaster to time-sensitive applications. So this idea aim to design and implement a new timestamp format and API that will never step backward and provide an easy-to-use interface for programs to fetch timestamp and process with it."

Moreover tessellation feature is not really used. This feature can do a lot more like displacement mapping support, complex geometry generation for water and terrain with tessellation stages, render physically correct movements with compute shader and tessellation stages.Finally, I want to improve how Ogre3D works on winRT."
Improve Progressive Mesh algorithm,OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) ,Peter Szücs,"It's waste of performance to have high quality models in faraway distance. Games can gain lot of performance by reducing faraway models and Ogre provides two methods for this: Manually created mesh LOD (for example in Blender) and generated mesh LOD. Blender supports nice reduction algorithms, why don't we just use that? First manually created mesh LOD creates a separated mesh for each LOD level, which means vertex data is duplicated for each LOD, which makes a big memory overhead. The memory overhead is needed, because Blender moves the vertices from original position to a calculated new position, so we need a separated vertex buffer too. Why don't we use Hoppe's algorithm or other more advanced techniques for reduction? These techniques have got the same problem as Blender. Also it would add limitations: For example if the mesh has bone weights or custom vertex data passed to a vertex shader than you can’t just insert a vertex. So the goal of my GSoC proposal is to improve current progressive mesh algorithm."

FlowVisor GUI,Open Networking Lab,m_broadbent,FlowVisor currently slices networks but unfortunately provides no mechanism to graphically visualise the slices. Visualising slices is not as trivial as it sounds because FlowVisor slices can be defined on any L1-L4 headers and such slices do not translate naturally to a visual representation. The idea here would be to use the existing API available in FlowVisor (and possibly add some more API) and develop a FlowVisor slice visualizer which will allow an administer and visualize their slices on a web UI.

Replace SQL DB by NOSQL DB,Open Networking Lab,Mikhail Fomichev,"FlowVisor currently relies on a SQL database for storing and persisting it's configuration. This is quite complicated and requires a lot of extra code to handle all the database accesses. More importantly, handling updates to the database requires FlowVisor to update the database schema which can be limiting and error prone. Finally, the current backend requires that all request come from the same JVM and incurs a performance hit on the overall system.The idea of this project is to replace this backend with a NoSQL storage to allow easier handling of the configuration and more flexibility in retrieving the configuration information."

Generic numerical optimization module,Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV),Alex Leontiev,"I propose to implement a set of generic algorithms for global optimization, that would find the global minima (maxima) of a given function over some region in high-dimensional space.This project suits both my interests and experience, as I enjoy implementing complicated mathematical algorithms (and have experience, see ""Experience"" section). This project is rare, as it allows me to alleviate my passion. Unfortunately, most numerical libraries would never accept just a student.Furthermore, I believe that having such a package, written from scratch with openCV design guidelines in mind and free of copyright issues, would provide a firm foundation for the stem of potential applications, that now either cannot be implemented, or suffer from inadequacies of presently available algorithms (e.g. calibration uses LM-optimization to minimize reprojection error, but there are issues)Finally, numerical coding is one of the most challenging things, I believe, and I would like to try it seriously. This is not just idle curiosity - I have some experience with both C++ (my biggest projects were written on it), C (I like it more, my latter projects are on it, so I greatly appreciate OpenCV’s idea of “restricted subset of C++”) and numerical programming."
Hand Tracking with Kinect,Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV),Gurpinder Singh Sandhu,"The aim of this project is to create a framework for detecting/tracking hand in the data available from kinect (and other RGB-D sensors). The approach is inspired from the Tracking-Learning-Detection (TLD) framework proposed by Kalal and team.The framework contains - a color+depth based tracker and an appearance based detection module. While the tracker is used to track the hand rather cheaply (in terms of computation), the detector is used to find hand in case of tracker failure due to occlusion and high speed movement. The detector module is a random-forest based classifier which is trained on the data available from the video (RGB-D) itself and does not require any proir training. Also this detector module is proposed to be trained on a separate thread.Additionally the framework also contains a module for tracking finger and palm detection for detecting finger tips (if visible) and palm center respectively.

Implementation and Validation of the Shape Context Descriptor,Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV),Juan Manuel Perez Rua,"The Shape Context descriptor was proposed by Serge Belongie and Jitendra Malik in 2000. This feature is a histogram based shape descriptor and includes an approach for point correspondence. This tool is naturally invariant to translation, small perturbations, and can be adapted to be rotation invariant, and more. These characteristics had been shown with a test framework based on known databases benchmarks.This is why I think Shape Context is a valuable contribution to OpenCV. However, this implementation should be done along with optimal histogram distance like EMD, and a classical shape comparison approach as the Hausdorff distance, in order to add a complete and robust shape descriptor/comparison tools to OpenCV. Implementations must be proved to work with the same database bench-marking used in the state of the art. "

Build a discussion system for the Open Build Service,openSUSE,Shayon Mukherjee,"The Open Build Service (OBS) is a generic system to build and distribute binary packages from sources in an automatic, consistent and reproducible way. You can release packages as well as updates, add-ons, appliances and entire distributions for a wide range of operating systems and hardware architectures.Although, unfortunately there isn’t a centralized way for packagers or even users to discuss different objects on OBS. Whatever communication happens is outside the OBS (IRC, mailing lists etc). That being said the project idea aims at implementing object specific discussion system in OBS(packages, projects and repositories).Also, instead of reinventing the wheel and creating a discussion system from scratch. The idea here is to extend on an external commenting system, acts_as_commentable_with_threading (https://github.com/elight/acts_as_commentable_with_threading). It will work seamlessly with OBS infrastructure and will be implemented on the front-end of OBS (webui instance)."

Implementation of candidate password generation on GPU for fast hashes. ,Openwall,Sayantan Datta,This project aims at eliminating the bottlenecks associated with password generation on CPU for fast hashes by producing the candidate password locally on GPU . 
Low-level GPU programming for John the Ripper,Openwall,Daniel Bali,"John the Ripper is the best open-source password cracker. Currently, John the Ripper has partial support for GPGPU computing. In some cases there are limitations in OpenCL that yield only sub-optimal results, similar to a CPU. There might be room for improvements using low level GPU computing, where we aren't bound by such limitations. This project will investigate how the speed of password cracking can be improved using the AMD GCN architecture. To work with the GCN architecture an assembler needs to be created. One possible solution is to use this assembler to patch already existing kernels with more efficient code. Another approach would be patching the kernels at run-time, for example when the kernel needs to be specialized for a given salt value.We might need a language that is slightly higher level than just plain assembly. Some support for structures like if/else statements and loops might be convenient. If time permits, the end result would be something similar to qhasm with GCN support."

 A partitioned approach to on demand increment graph assembly for pgRouting.,OSGeo - Open Source Geospatial Foundation ,Mukul Priya," pgRouting has been working towards providing routing functionality on a PostGis/PostgreSqlGeo spatialdatabase. It already has support for shortest path algorithm like astar ,dijkstra , tdsp and trsp .But for a very large network, routing becomes time consuming. Network partitioning is one such way which can prove to be helpful in improving the overall time efficiency of routing querries. The main ideahere is to first partitionthe whole network using a Quad tree approach and when the shortest path is computed these partitions are loaded on demand. hence , there is an on demand incremental graph generation while the shortest path is being computed."

Also functions that allow to explore stops (using OSM data) and transit network information, such as the display of complete routes, are new features that should be worked on."
Design and implement an API for tiled vectorial support of POIProxy for gvSIG Mini,OSGeo - Open Source Geospatial Foundation ,Arturo," The idea consists in creating a brand new POIProxy client based on gvSIG Mini that will provide access to a set of geo-location services.	Technically this project pretends to provide gvSIG Mini with a simple API to support POIProxy services. The API will offer transparent support to load a geo-located service, make requests as the user navigates the map, cache data (into memory and disk in standard GeoJSON) to speed up the data-load, and build the user interfaces to show extra data, such as additional info, media (images, video), etc.	The user will have the chance to load one or more POIProxy layers that will make requests to geo-location services as the user navigates the map. That functionality will offer social and contextual information related to the location of the user.	On the other hand, gvSIG Mini don’t provide any geocoding nor reverse-geocoding service. POIProxy is a good candidate to provide those services.	"

Constraints Handling Techniques in Evolutionary Algorithms,PaGMO / PyGMO,Jérémie Labroquère,"Because of the stochastic behavior of Evolutionary Algorithms, some constraints handling methods use empirical parameters defined by the user to take into account constraints violation during the optimization process. Unfortunately these parameters can drive the optimizer to local optima and are usually effective for a single problem. This proposal consists in implementing in PyGMO/PagMO more or less sophisticated constraints handling techniques that are problem independent and to test them against a set of typical problems. In an implementation point of view, most of the constraint handling techniques can be seen as a modification of the initial constrained problem, algorithm or population. Thus, the implementation will consists in redefining the initial problem/algorithm/population through the use of operators/modifiers."

Hyperfast hypervolumes for Multi-objective optimization,PaGMO / PyGMO,Krzysztof Nowak,"Project involves computation of hypervolume in higher dimensional spaces for a set ofhypercubes sharing one common point (reference point that strictly dominates the wholeset). It is a geometrical interpretation of quality measure for a Pareto set. It can be usedas a comparison between two population of individuals, and as a fitness function duringthe evolution phase in the genetic algorithm. First scenario allows for exact computation,since time is not as crucial of a factor, as it is in second case (executing hypervolumecomputation during the algorithm). This requires implementation of both exact andapproximated methods. Additionally, few methods have been proposed thatuse hypervolume as a input for the fitness measure. I intend to implement at least one ofthem during the GSoC as well."

The most straightforward enhancement is to enable stochastic optimization problems to be solved more efficiently without too much modification to the existing algorithms. A perhaps more interesting consequent of the racing module would be an in-house automatic parameter configuration system for PaGMO optimizers / meta-heuristics. This could potentially mean that in future, algorithms implemented in PaGMO will no longer require (heavy) manual parameter tuning."

Automated Testing,phpMyAdmin,Adam Kang,"PMA is a popular web based database management tool. It usually undergoes new releases, bug fixes, new feature development and refactoring. Since the PMA production code is changed frequently and our code is finished by developers from all over the world, in order to guarantee the production quality, it is very necessary to run Unit testing on Jenkins (Hudson). Unit Tests have several benefits to us. It allows us changing code quickly under full testing. By running unit tests, a developer can identify whether his latest changes to the code base has broken anything. Unit Tests can also help new developers really understand the design of the code and it can give our developers visual feedback about which lines are covered. From PMA CI Page, Currently, the code coverage of PMA is 18.3%.More code coverage means more guarantee to production. Goal:1.	Increase the code coverage to a reasonable percentage (80%)2.	Set up the necessary scripts to automate unit testing. 3.	Help other developers to set up their unit test cases.4.

phpMyAdmin Interface Improvements,phpMyAdmin,Kasun Chathuranga,"phpMyAdmin is quite a matured project with more than 14 years of history behind it. It possesses almost all the major features required for a database administrative tool and there is very little that can be added in this front. However there is always room for small and medium scale new features. This is evident from the huge backlog of feature requests requested in the project’s feature request tracker. In this proposal, I propose a number of small to medium scale improvements chosen from the feature request tracker, majority of them selected by the developers of the project themselves and listed in the GSoC 2013 project ideas list."
Re-factoring: server view,phpMyAdmin,xmujay (Bin Zu),"While reading some server view source code of PMA, I found that the source code has some problems: not easy read, not easy reusable, full of long function, full of long file. Because PMA is a big project which is developed by a lot of Programmers from all over the world, we should enhance the maintainability to let more developers join in. From other side, in a project’s life cycle, sometimes we need to re-factor the code if the code starts smelling bad and it’s hard to maintain and even harder to add new features. By enhancing the readability and maintainability of code, re-factoring makes it easier for us to deal with the code. This idea aims to re-factor the code on “Server view” and make the code easy to understand and easy to reuse. It won't involve changing the existing functionality of these scripts, nor would it introduce new functionality. "

So with the help of these landmarks, an analytics app can be developed in malls which will have the option of annotating these landmarks with comments, pictures and other data"
Cube extension improvement,PostgreSQL Project,Stas Kelvich,"In present state cube extension allows to create indices suitable for search queries with several diapasons (e. g. diapasons for price, dates, distance). The main issue of the cube extension is the big index size, therefore building index and reading a large number of records becomes very expensive disk-related operation. More careful leaf node organization in R-Tree can significantly reduce index size. Also with new kNN framework it is possible to create ordering operator for retrieval sorted data directly from the index and ordering operators for kNN with different spatial norms."

ASCEND: dynamic modelling improvements,Python Software Foundation,Ksenija Bestuzheva,"There are models with variable structure which are currently not supported by ASCEND. These are, for example, models with hysteresis or with complex boundary conditions. More generally, they have not only region behavior (for which ASCEND has WHEN statements), but also boundary behavior: some actions should be performed exactly at the boundaries. After thinking over the problem I made a conclusion that there are two main types of actions: solving systems of boundary equations and assigning values to some variables. In order to implement this ASCEND needs new syntax and new solver behavior."

Multiple conditions may be chained together using logical operators such as ""and"", ""or"", ""not"".Note: the link in the field ""additional info"" points to a PDF of my curriculum vitae."
Twisted: Deferred Cancellation,Python Software Foundation,kai,"Deferreds are Twisted's abstraction for an eventual result of a task. They provide a cancellation API to add a hook for cancelling the task. However, many Twisted APIs that return Deferreds don't use this cancellation API which means they don't provide cancellation support. This project would add cancellation support to as many APIs as possible (though I will focus on SMTP, POP3, IMAP4, DNS, HTTP related APIs), starting with easy cases and moving on to more difficult ones. "
Twisted: Switching to Formal Parsers,Python Software Foundation,introom,"Currently Twisted uses ad-hoc parsing methods to parse protocols. The ad-hoc parsing often produces scattered code and makes the code difficult to read and debug. To overcome this problem, I will use Parsley to rewrite the parsing part. In the rewritten version, there will be unified parsing grammar and dedicated classes that handle parsing logic. Thus, the parsing code will be less error-prone and more concise. Moreover, parsing performance will be easily improved by enhancing Parsley itself."
Upload Strategy of Happiness in Tahoe-LAFS,Python Software Foundation,Mark Berger,"Currently the share placement algorithm is not designed to meet the criteria established by the ""servers of happiness"" test. This leads to various issues in which share placement does not satisfy the test even though it is possible to do so. Implementing a new share placement algorithm would fix these types of issues."
wxPython Bindings for PyPy using CFFI,Python Software Foundation,Tyler Wade,"There are currently no GUI toolkits that properly support PyPy.Although the existing wxPython and Tkinter implementations have some partial compatibility, they are supported via the CPython extension emulation layer.The goal of this project will be to create wxPython bindings which are compatible with PyPy.These bindings will use the CFFI library to interface with the native code and will be based off of wxPython Phoenix, a work-in-progress re-write of the original bindings."

Also the GUI would be packaged with the libraries it uses so that it could be installed out of the box."
Atomic Operations and SMP lock debug tool for RTEMS,RTEMS Project,Deng Hengyi,"This project is continuation of last year GSOC project. In the last year the architecture-independent atomic API has been developed and the implementation of X86 and PowerPC has been completed. So in this year the project’ goal is to support all other architectures. The task includes that a general atomic ops should be defined to support all the architectures which do not support SMP mode. And in order to make RTEMS support SMP completely it also should make the existing synchronization primitives SMP-safe, such as semaphores, mutex, spinlocks and etc. But this task is complex and is hard to debug. So in there I proposal a lock debug tool used to debug the lock problem, like deadlock and recursive lock."
Enhance low-level API of libmm (Memory Protection & Caches) ,RTEMS Project,Hesham Moustafa AL-matary,"The current code of MMU support is not mature enough.

Reworking the Initialization of Rails,Ruby on Rails, on Rails,"Ruby on Rails currently implements the singleton design pattern for applications in a Ruby process. This rigid architecture causes global configurations to persist in an application and prevents developers from configuring multiple distinct applications. The current initialization sequence of Ruby on Rails also prevents developers from configuring an application and initializing the application based on that configuration. My work will attempt to solve this problem by 1) removing the singleton design pattern, 2) allowing each application to have its own configuration, and 3) reordering the initialization sequence so that applications are configured before they are initialized."

Merge Kilauea and Vesuvius Trunks,Sahana Software Foundation,Kaushika Rukshan Athukorala,"Full merging of Vesuvius and Kilauea code bases into single trunk. Deployment settings (like Eden) will determine front-end functionality (missing persons, shelter registration, staff registration, etc.). This would greatly broaden the potential user base for both of these products, which otherwise will remain highly customized for a single customer and likely not adopted by other organizations."
Native Synchronization between Vesuvius Instances,Sahana Software Foundation,Gurutharshan,"Instances of Vesuvius (say, in different cities or hospitals) can currently interchange missing/found person data using the PFIF protocol, but that exchange is lossy and requires a Google Person Finder go-between.

Portable App Dynamic Creation for Vesuvius Platform,Sahana Software Foundation,Akila Ravihansa Perera,"A portable application for Sahana Vesuvius platform can be deployed into a portable device (typically application files will be stored on a fast flash drive) which is not necessarily connected to the Internet. A user can directly launch the portable app without any pre-configuration or installation of any software (Apache, MySQL, PHP). The user will be able to work on Vesuvius in offline mode (no Internet connectivity). This portable app is essentially a portable AMP stack and Vesuvius PHP code deployed to ‘www’ root in the portable app. It acts like a local server in a host device and if WiFi/Bluetooth support is enabled in this device (which is the usual case for portable devices), other nearby WiFi/Bluetooth enabled devices within the communication range are able to connect to the host device which runs a local instance of Vesuvius (let’s call it child instance). One of the important features of the portable app is the data synchronization of missing/found persons with the statically deployed Vesuvius instance (let’s call it parent instance) whenever a stable network connection is established between the child instance and the parent instance."
Search Project,Sahana Software Foundation,Vishrut Mehta,"The aim of this project is to enable users to search text/strings into the uploaded reports/documents.

This proposal writes about a plan to extend scaffold-hunter with two more views. The first part of this proposal explains the plan on how to do this, the second half talks about the already known knowledge of the proposer. "
Visual Feature Selection/Dynamic Visualization ,Scaffold Hunter,falk,"Current state of the art:           Scaffold Hunter (SH) was designed as a Visual Analytics tool for chemical space. Recently, a plugin was developed that leverages SH for the visual analysis of content-based medical image retrieval (VAMIR). Different from traditional approaches relying on textual annotations and queries, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) exploits visual features that in the medical domain may comprise segmented anatomical or pathological regions, their spatial relationships, volume and texture as well as Wavelet- and Fourier-transformations. A typical CBIR framework presents the user a result list sorted according to some similarity metric that accumulates all features used for image comparison. This way, no insight is given on which and how features have contributed to the ranking. In a novel approach, the VAMIR plugin allowed SH to visualize the outcome of a CBIR algorithm in a way that enables the user to make judgements about a query’s similarity to other database entries with respect to selected features.           Motivation for this project:         The tool’s performance is promising, but VAMIR is still at a prototype stage. A current shortcoming consists in the static nature of the feature set that is visualized, which needs to be specified in a config file before execution. Also, no hint is given as to which feature set is likely to profit from a visual analysis (with respect to the Visual Analytics core mantra of “discovering the unexpected”). Implementation of methods to dynamically select a set of features to be visualized as well as computerized reasoning behind a meaningful starting set of features would mean an essential step away from VAMIR’s prototype stage towards a deployable application. "
Comprehensive Comprehensions,Scala Team,Chris Hodapp,"In this proposal I explain my plan togreatly improve the utility of forcomprehensions in Scala. My proposalis based on a Pre-SIP by Stefan Zeiger, a Pre-SIP by Christopher Vogt and JanBraun, and the original ComprehensiveComprehensions (henceforth, _CC_)paper by Phillip Wadler and SimonPeyton (with generalizations).If myproposal is implemented, forcomprehensions would gain a powersimilar to what is offered by LINQ on.NET, but, of course, since this isScala, they wouldn't be nearly soinflexible as LINQ, allowing seamlessintegration of any correctly-signauturedmethod defined on comprehendables."
Constraint Solver in Scala,Scala Team,Matthias Schlaipfer,"This GSoC project proposal is based on the idea described at http://lara.epfl.ch/w/solver. It consists of two separate goals: First, DPLL(T) solving architecture. Currently scabolic uses an imperative solving algorithm which is difficult to modify. DPLL(T) is well-established and would provide a better framework. One part of this implementation is incremental SAT solving. Second, a decision procedure to reason about functional data structures. Such a decision procedure is, for example, described in the paper ""Decision procedures for algebraic data types with abstractions"". Having such an implementation would, for example, allow to replace Z3 as the theory solver in Leon. It would be nice to have the complete stack written in Scala. Especially regarding certain optimizations, which are impossible with a black box solver."
Cross-language refactorings for the Scala IDE,Scala Team,Michael Holzer,This proposal aims to improve the refactoring support of the Scala IDE. Right now refactorings on Scala code are not connected to refactorings on Java code - this may lead to problems in projects with a mixed codebase in Scala and Java. The main goal is to provide a reliable crosslanguage version of the 'Rename' refactoring. Additional goals are to extend the Rename refactoring to Play framework templates and routing files in the Scala IDE Play plugin.
Numerically Solving Partial Differential Equations,Scala Team,Timothy Spurdle,"Many of models in science are based upon partial differential equations. In most cases, these equations are too complicated to solve exactly or even to approximate mathematically. To remedy this, we resort to using numerical methods. Scala's blend of object-oriented and functional programming paradigms provides a nice framework for working in, but it's main advantage is building libraries with an easy to use user iterface."
parboiled2: a macro-based PEG parser generator for Scala,Scala Team,Alexander Myltsev,"Grammar-based parsing of text data is a ubiquitous problem in real-world applications. One popular technique for implementing parsers is parser combinators. However, even though it's comparatively easy to build a parser with combinators the end-result is logic that essentially ""interprets"" the grammar rules against the input, which is rather slow. Hand-writing a parser can yield a much faster implementation but is tedious and error-prone.It is possible to implement a parser defined via an embedded DSL that is translated into runnable code by the host language compiler at compile time. The macro support introduced with Scala 2.10 provides the required and sufficient infrastructure for such an endeavor.The goal of this project is to use Scala 2.10 macros to implement a compile-time generator for highly efficient PEG parsers. Rule definition is based on the parboiled DSL embedded in Scala with a few extensions (such as shapeless' HLists for combining flexibility with strong type-safety)."

Such a feature would be a powerful tool in the hands of programmers attempting to debug their code. It will consist of a new window mode in Kojo, where pressing a ""trace"" button will trace the program. A history of the trace will allow the user to go through all calls and see the state of visible variables at that point."

Specializing parallel collections with customized work-stealing and Scala Macros and developing micro-benchmarking suite for collections.,Scala Team,Dmytro Petrashko,"This project aims at creating new parallel collection implementations, that take advantage of macros to generate a specialized parallel operation instance for a particular invocation. This specialized parallel operation instance avoids abstraction overheads such as boxing, dynamic dispatch or iterator state updates.Orthogonally, to improve scalability for data-parallel operations on highly irregular workloads, work-stealing tree scheduling will be used. Work-stealing tree scheduling is a novel scheduling technique for load-balancing parallel execution of highly irregular data-parallel workloads currently being implemented as part of the Parallel Collections for the Scala programming language.To ensure scalability and the appropriate performance of the new parallel collection implementations, a suite of micro-benchmarks and benchmark applications is planned to be developed using the ScalaMeter performance regression testing tool previously developed as part of the Scala programming language project."

Integrating Marisa Chan's Z-Engine Implementation into the ScummVM set of Engines,ScummVM,RichieSams,"The ZVision is used in the games Zork Nemesis and Zork Grand Inquisitor. Marisa Chan created a C implementation of the engine, but it is only for desktop and requires configuration files. This project aims to create a ScummVM engine using Marisa Chan’s implementation code as a guide into the Zork file structure and engine design. That is, it will not simply adapt the current implementation to the ScummVM engine structure. Rather, it will create a new engine, using the file structures and event implementations in Marisa Chan’s code as a reference. ScummVM will allow these games to be played on a variety of platforms and a redesign will remove the need for configuration files. Lastly, it will mean that ScummVM will support all of the Zork point'n'click adventure games."

ADJ is the problem of finding a matrix, or set of basis vectors, that best diagonalizes a set of input matrices. It is an important tool playing a critical role in many applications including ICA and BSS. For machine learning in particular ICA can be used for pre-processing, automatic feature selection and dimensionality reduction for visualization. ADJ would be a valuable addition to the SHOGUN toolbox."
Implement estimators of large-scale sparse Gaussian densities,Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox,Soumyajit De,"Computing log-likelihood for Gaussian distribution requires computation of log-determinant of the covariance (or precision) matrix. Usual approach, based on Cholesky factorization, often suffers from huge memory requirement for fill-in phenomenon when the covariance matrix is huge and sparse. This project aims for computing the log-determinant in an efficient way, which makes use of a bunch of techniques from numerical linear algebra and complex analysis. The objective of this project is to approximate the matrix-logarithm up to an arbitrary precision and evaluate log-determinant with reduced memory requirement, targeting for speeding up by enabling parallel computation of the components involved."

As a consequence, a project management system like Sigmah must let the possibility to let its users change their projects along they way, and keep tracks of those different versions. In the contractual world that link often humanitarian organisations with their public donors, those versions are usually linked with an Amendment."
Interactive and Visual Test Automation for SDL 2.0,Simple DirectMedia Layer,Apoorv,"The testsprite2 test in the SDL test suite accepts a large number of parameters (26) and based on the values of those parameters it launches a window and moves some sprites on the screen. Other than ensuring that the rendering is happening correctly, this test is also used to check if the mouse is being handled correctly and the window looks as it should look (with correct title, icon, position, etc).This makes it an important test in the SDL test suite. Unfortunately, since there are many parameters with many valid combinations, it is impossible to manually test all of them. This project attempts to automate running and validating the output of testsprite2."
Multi-platform meta-build system for SDL 2.0,Simple DirectMedia Layer,Avail,"Due to the hassle of trying to maintain multiple build systems for a variety of platforms, SDL 2.0 needs a singular build system which can target multiple platforms simultaneously, thus significantly improving maintainability and minimizing potential inconsistencies across multiple build systems."

Efficient Interpretation for SBCL,Steel Bank Common Lisp,Matthias Benkard,"The project is to write a minimal compiler of ANSI Common Lisp code to an intermediate representation that can be interpreted efficiently within an existing Common Lisp system, along with the corresponding interpreter.The compiler/interpreter combination will be designed as an alternative to the high-overhead native code compilation process that SBCL already provides, intended to be used in situations where compilation overhead weighs more heavily than raw performance of compiled code."
Modernising register allocation in SBCL,Steel Bank Common Lisp,Asya,"This project aims to improve the compiler back end by enhancing the register allocation procedure.To realize this goal, we propose to implement (i) a new heuristic optimization based on coloring the global interference graph, (ii) live ranges and live range splitting,(iii) spill code insertion.The task of the register allocator is to assign an unconstrainednumber of temporary names (TNs) in the intermediate representation(IR) to a finite number of registers.A naive approach yields toomany memory operations resulting in a reduced execution speed. Thecurrently implemented SBCL register allocator performs only graphcoloring, essentially treating spills by coloring with stack slots. Inorder to improve the allocator, we propose to integrate a newheuristic graph coloring method inspired by the concepts introduced byBriggs et al. (1994) in the SBCL compiler.According to Briggs'results of the optimistic coloring, the proposed enhancements can beexpected to increase performance of produced code by up to 15\%."

Risch algorithm for symbolic integration,SymPy,Chetna,"The Risch algorithm is a complete algorithm to integrate any elementary function. Given an elementary function, it will either produce an antiderivative, or prove that none exists.The project is to continue where Aaron Meurer left off in his 2010 GSoC project, implementing the algorithm from Manuel Bronstein's book, Symbolic Integration I: Transcendental Functions. A successful implementation of this would not only provide concrete algorithms for transcendental functions but would also form the basis for very similar Karr Algorithm, decision procedure for symbolic summation, yet to be implemented in Sympy. This could also prove a quick start for further extension to build Risch Algorithms for Algebraic functions and hence needs to be taken immediately to complete the integral module in sympy."
Vector calculus module,SymPy,Prasoon Shukla,"This project aims to implement a module facilitating the usage of vectors and allowing users to perform vector calculus operations.

Modern Web Interface for Systers member's area,"Systers, an Anita Borg Institute Community",Dardie,"A mailing list's member's area is typically the user's ""dashboard"". It allows him/her to configure their mailing lists, subscribe or unsubscribe to lists and basically control every aspect of their subscription. While mailman provides a lot of functionality for creating and maintaining mailing lists, the basic interface that the user is faced with is un-intuitive at best. Regular users will eventually learn to use the mailing list but new users, especially those who are accustomed to dynamic, responsive and interactive webpages will find it quite difficult. Powerful systems need to be coupled with simple interfaces that enable users to get the most out of the community. Please go to http://roughroughbook.blogspot.in/ to view the mockup.The proposed interface builds on top of existing Mailman and WebKitty modules."

Extraction of Ontologies terms from free form clinical notes,The Centre for Computational Medicine,Ravi Garg,"Phenotips is a web based software tool that provides doctors/clinicians easy to use interface for maintaining and analyzing patient data in an efficient way. PhenoTips right now provides an auto-suggest feature whereby doctor/clinician can search for the respective Phenotype. This is based on Apache Lucene/Solr based back-end search system. However Human Phenotype Ontology has approximately 10,000 terms associated and it is not possible for any user to remember every single one. Therefore through this project I propose to build a system which will facilitate the migration of patient records into Phenotips by automatically extracting Human Phenotype Ontology terms from the free form clinical text. This will not only be a user friendly arrangement but will also help him/her save a lot of time in the process."

Expansion of SPARKS HTML5 circuit simulator to include non-linear and active devices,The Concord Consortium,Sabareesh Nikhil C,"Simulation of circuits on SPARKS in currently limited to those comprising lumped elements that are both linear and passive. A step ahead would be to allow inclusion of a larger variety of circuit elements that exhibit nonlinearity, beginning from, but not limited to, diodes, and subsequently, active devices such as mechanical relays and transistors.The difficulty in implementing active and general nonlinear circuit elements in the frequency domain would require us to add a new functionality, where time domain analysis is performed on the circuit to solve it. Enabling time domain analysis would also greatly enhance the flexibility of the base in supporting further development of SPARKS. Also, transforming the currently existing circuit elements (impedances and sinusoidal and DC voltage sources) to time domain is not difficult, and I intend to kick off with this.Over the summer, I plan to include diodes, relays and simplistic transistors into the list of circuit elements supported by SPARKS. Also, given that implementing a time domain analysis will ensure that periodic non-sinusoidal voltage sources (such as triangular wave and square wave voltage sources) can be easily implemented as well, I look forward to completing the same in the GSoC.Another objective I would like to accomplish (courtesy: Paul Horowitz and Sam Fentress) is to implement communication between breadboards to encourage greater collaboration between students.I look forward to utilizing this GSoC as an opportunity for me to enter the world of open-source, and kick off with a successful expansion of SPARKS."

Eclipse Code Recommenders - Models API,The Eclipse Foundation,Olav Lenz,"The Eclipse Code Recommenders project provides intelligent code completion, basing its recommendations both on the context where the completion is triggered and on the knowledge of analysed source code (stored in models). At the moment the implementation of this mechanism in Eclipse Code Recommenders is not flexible enough. One problem is that it is not possible to run the recommendation process headless outside an Eclipse environment. Furthermore the UI Integration of the preference page for the Eclipse Code Recommenders should be improved, because of the bad usability for end users which are properly not so familiar with the background of the Eclipse Code Recommenders mechanism. The intention of this GSoC Project is to redesign the models API to eliminate the described problems and to prepare for the future and for many new intelligent Eclipse Code Recommenders."

Financial IS for Fedora project ,The Fedora Project,Uditha Bandara Wijerathna,"In the financial perspective, fedora project can be categorized in to “non-profit organizations”. So it'll be good to have an internal finance system for Fedora Project to handle the budget and transactions in a detailed and very transparent way. Normally Fedora project community plans the budget for an upcoming fiscal year containing four quarters.And after the budget planning is finished, Red Hat, the sponsor of the Fedora Project will allocate funding the particular budget. Basically this with done by OSAS team and FPL. But there aren't any transaction recording and accounting system at the moment within the fedora project. So my plan is to develop a system that practices the well known double entry system and generate customized reports about the transaction details which are done within the project. customized to integrate with the fedora project's budget and funding routine."

Thug Distributed Task Queuing ,The Honeynet Project,Akshit Agarwal,Previously Thug worked like a stand-alone tool and does not provide any way to distribute URL analysis tasks to different workers. For the same reason it was neither able to analyze difference in attacks to users according to their geolocation (unless it is provided a set of differently geolocated proxies to use obviously). Now after implementation of this project we are able to solve both problems by creating a centralized server which will be connected to all the Thug instances running across the globe and will distribute URLs (potentially according to geolocation analysis requirements). After that the clients will consume the tasks distributed by centralized server and will store the results in database after processing them.
Abstract Model Checking,The Java Pathfinder Team,Jakub Daniel,"Abstract Pathfinder is an existing extension of Java Pathfinder (JPF) which allows for different abstractions of numeric types during model checking with JPF.In this project, we will build upon it by investigating possible approaches to the use of predicates as a supplementary type of abstraction to what already exist in the Abstract Pathfinder.Furthermore, we will implement the chosen approach as a part of the project.The solution will address various important features of Java - such as objects, classes, fields, arrays, local variables - and constraints over numeric types.The overall goal of this project is to enable proper use of predicate abstraction in JPF with a well-defined and complete extension that has its own predicate language."
An Eclipse Plug-in for Library Specifications Learning through Testing and Model Checking,The Java Pathfinder Team,Spencer Xiao,In this project we are going to develop an Eclipse Plug-in which automatically learns the behavior specifications of library classes by combining testing and symbolic execution within a practically reasonable time cost. The behavior specifications are the correct call sequences with preconditions for each method call to a function defined in the class. The plug-in enables library developer checking whether the implementation complies with his/her mental model and it also reduces a library user’s effort to understand the correct specification of the library by reading through the documentation or comments with the library. 
Analysis of biological models in Symbolic PathFinder,The Java Pathfinder Team,José Miguel Rojas,"This project aims at modelling biological systems in a Statechart dialect of Java and applying model checking techniques to verify properties of interest such as stabilization or consistency with respect to a set of laboratory experimental observations.In particular, the project will focus on the C. elegans roundworm, which is a model organism extensively used in biological research because of its simplicity and tractability.The project will provide implementations for the particular composition operator and abstractions used in these models.The tool to be developed should be simple, intuitive and user-friendly in order to actually be useful for biological researchers."
Automated Model Generation for Library Code,The Java Pathfinder Team,Matteo Ceccarello,"The JPF model checker relies on so-called model classes in order to combat the notorious state space explosion problem. The burden of writing model class is almost entirely on the developer. To help the developer in this error prone and tedious task, a tool, called model-generator, has already been developed. However this tool generates only empty stubs, forcing the developer to add the desired behaviour manually.The goal of this project is to provide a tool that can generate model classes with behaviour automatically."
Combining JDart and Randoop,The Java Pathfinder Team,Marko Dimjašević,Achieving high code coverage in testing of real-world software is challenging. High code coverage is important because code coverage gives a measure of how thoroughly the software has been tested. This proposal addresses the challenge of reaching high code coverage by proposing a novel iterative algorithm for generating unit tests in JDart. The algorithm exploits both random and systematic software testing and software verification techniques. Preliminary results show the algorithm outperforms existing techniques.
Computing Observable Modified Condition/Decision Coverage,The Java Pathfinder Team,Daniela Grijincu,"A significant issue when auto-generating tests is the effectiveness of the resulting test suite at finding faults. Structural coverage metrics, such as branch coverage, are used to guide automated test generation, but previous experiments have shown that such suites, when generated using model checking often do not provide good fault finding. This GSoC project will create an extension to JPF that will implement and evaluate automated test generation using a new test metric Observable Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (OMC/DC), which is an extension of the MC/DC metric that is used in safety-critical domains. Auto generated OMC/DC tests have been shown to be more effective at finding faults than MC/DC tests in a recent ICSE 2013 paper (""Observable Modified Condition/Decision Coverage"" by Michael Whalen, Gregory Gay, Dongjiang You, Mats P. E. Heimdahl and Matt Staats) that targets data-flow programs (e.g. Simulink models). In this project, the notion of OMC/DC will be applied to Java files."
Habanero Deadlock Detector,The Java Pathfinder Team,Brandon,"To keep up with the high demand of computer processing speed, concurrency will be important to the computer programming industry. Habanero Java (HJ) is a simple library that allows concurrency. Combined with Java Pathfinder (JPF), a user program can be run. JPF will then report if their program data-races, deadlocks, there are assertion violations or not. However, since HJ runtime library is fairly linear, and the concurrency scheduling is operating system dependent, it only looks at a small limited number of possible outcomes and may not find any data-races or deadlocks even if they are possible. Our project will help solve this problem, and find several possible outcomes of a precompiled HJ program with JPF. If a deadlock is possible, JPF will be able to report where the deadlock occurred."

Formalization of Correct Usage of Kernel Core API,The Linux Foundation,Misha,"LDV tools are used to check Linux device drivers against several safety rules, each of which formally defines what is a correct usage of the particular part of kernel core API. Each rule also represents one or more typical misuses of the kernel core interfaces. By the moment, the framework contains about30 formalized rules. This project is aimed at extending the number of rules supported by the framework."
Generation of Environment Model for Verification of Multi-module Device Drivers,The Linux Foundation,Ilja Zakharov,"Linux Driver Verification project has the goal to provide high quality framework which allows using different static analysis tools to verify whether drivers satisfy correctness rules. Linux device drivers can't be analyzed separately from the kernel core due to their large interdependency between each other. But source code of the whole Linux kernel is rather complex and huge to be analyzed by existing model checking tools. Therefore drivers should be analyzed with environment models instead of the real kernel core. Currently LDV tools analyze only a chunk of code that is a separate loadable kernel module. Sometimes analysis of only one module leads to sophisticated or even incorrect environment model, because drivers can contain several modules or common routines from a driver are picked out to a library module. Thus environment model should be generated for groups of interacting modules rather than for separate modules of these groups."
Improve multi-version support in automatically generated LSB test suites,The Linux Foundation,Elena Egorova,LSB provides a lot of tests to check compatibility of distributions and applications. The aim of this project is to simplify support of several test suites by implementing multi-version support and eliminating the need to maintain several versions of test suites.
Improving performance of the KernelStrider tools,The Linux Foundation,Maxim Kouprianov,"The KernelStrider tools collect information about the memory accesses and function calls that the target kernel module makes. The information is passed to the user space for further processing. Since the amount of data generated in the kernel space is large enough, that requires more computing power to successfully transfer that data from the kernel. It is clean that we need to apply some compressing methods at the kernel side and some decompressing methods when captured data is being processed."

Verification of Linux file systems drivers by combination of static and dynamic analysis,The Linux Foundation,Denis,File systems modules are one of the most widely used components of Linux. Each Linux user needs these modules to operate correctly. Errors in file system drivers can lead to serious consequences - from data distortion and loss to critical security vulnerabilities. The change log of Linux kernel shows that errors in file systems modules are still quite common. It is possible to automate file systems modules testing process by make use of special tools combining static and dynamic analysis.

Port Linux's drm/kms/gem/i915,The NetBSD Foundation,Myron Aub,Finish the partial port of Linux's drm/kms/gem/i915 drivers that I began this year.
System upgrade,The NetBSD Foundation,gnrp,"NetBSD currently has no option to upgrade the system without issueing one command. When you do an upgrade from sources, you have to rebuild everything (or only the updated part), copy the new kernel, boot into the new kernel and then do an installation from the build.sh script (i.e., `build.sh install` or `make installworld`). The part with the kernel can be skipped when you are only doing userland upgrades. When upgrading to a new (even minor) release, you should run etcupdate(8).While this process is rather simple due to build.sh and make wrappers around everything, the process with binary updates is rather complicated. First, you have to dig into the details of NetBSD release engineering (e.g., when a security advisory [SA] occurs, there are only instructions how to *rebuild* NetBSD with the patch applied). Then, you have to choose a mirror, download the sets you think are appropriate for an update, unpack the kernel, boot into it, and *carefully* unpack them to your root directory (such that permissions are preserved). After that, you run etcupdate(8) again. "
Implementation of WAVE 1609.4/802.11p for ns-3,The ns-3 Network Simulator Project,Junling Bu,"Since WAVE communication standards have been published, there exist many relevant implementations including prototypes, products, and simulations. However the implementation varies significantly, some of them even based on old draft standards. And in some existed simulations and research papers, WiFi is used directly for V2V and V2I communication which decrease reliability of result. Besides that, ns-3 has no complete WAVE module yet.So I plan to implement WAVE 1609.4/802.11p in mac layer for ns-3."

Implement CoAP (Conditional-)Observe in Wiselib,The Wiselib,Philipp Abraham,"CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks. Resources (containing sensor informations) on a CoAP Server can change their state over time. To keep clients updated with the latest values the ""CoAP Observe"" extension has been proposed. In order to minimize the amount of data sent over the network, a client could also register for notifications of certain changes only (e.g. ""notify me whenever the luminance changes drastically"" ). For these scenarios, the ""conditional observe"" extension to CoAP is being developed. My proposal would be to extend the current CoAP implementation for Wiselib to support the ""observe"" and ""conditional observe"" extensions. Additionally I would try to implement the upcoming draft of high level states which enables a client to create resources with special names for ranges of values (e.g. ""hot"" for values between 30°C - 40°C)."
IPv6 extension with Distributed Protocol Stacks,The Wiselib,Dániel Géhberger,"The IPv6 protocol stack has been already implemented for The Wiselib, but some complicated, heavy parts (eg.: 6LoWPAN, Neighbor Discovery Protocol) need too much program memory and as a result the protocol stack is usable only on less resource constraineddevices. The proposed implementation of the Distributed Protocol Stacks (DPS) enables the usage of more resource constrained platforms as well. With this solution a DPS client node has to bear only with the UDP and the basic ICMPv6 layers and it is able to use the rest of the protocol stack on the DPS server via remote procedure calls. Depending on the used testbed/deployment the implementation of the DPS can even multiply the number of IPv6 ready devices with The Wiselib."
Javascript Interface for Remote Controlling WISEBED Nodes,The Wiselib,Fabian Bormann,"""The Wisebed Testbed enables the easy deployment of large scale wireless sensor network experiments without the need to buy the expensive sensor node hardware. However, programmers still have to learn an embedded programming language and put up with the tedious debugging characteristics of a large embedded network. To lower these prerequisites for starting with the development of sensor network applications (e.g., for students), this projects aims at creating a remote control interface for wisebed nodes, which allows the easy programming and debugging of these applications inside a Webbrowser. For this, several wiselib applications need to be implemented for the different sensor node platforms, which expose the fundamental functions of the node hardware (such as: send(), receive(), getSensorValue() or switchOnLed()) to a Control Server, which is connected to all nodes via the testbed infrastructure. The Control Server then exposes these interfaces via a JavaScript interface, which allows the remote development and debugging of a sensor node application inside the browser of the programmer, enabling the interactive reprogramming of the nodes at runtime."" - http://www.wiselib.org/gsoc/project_ideas.html"
Wiselib Online Editing Service,The Wiselib,M.Ravi,"Wiselib supports a variety of target platforms (including different WSN hardware platforms, Android, Linux, iOS, and the Shawn simulator). This requires a very complex, error-prone, and time-consuming installation and configuration of all required tools and components to help developers work productivity. To ease this process, the goal of this project is to implement a cloud service for editing Wiselib code. Users just need to create an account and work on their fork of wiselib (or the original repository) to edit their code and collaborate with their colleagues. The service shall be designed as a RESTful web-based editor and use a remote compilation service for compilation on a subset of Wiselib platforms."

Reduce RTT for preemptively built circuits,Tor,ra,"Round-Trip-Times (RTT) of circuits can be measured by violating the exit policy of exit nodes by sending a ""STREAM CONNECT"" request to 127.0.0.1. Since the exit policy denies this connection, the request results in an error that can be timed in a measuring client. It is assumed that the RTTs are Fréchet-distributed and its tail can be approximated to be Pareto-distributed. This information can be used to reject a preemptively built circuit if its RTT is below a certain threshold value.It will be checked if the above assumption is valid and if performance of circuits can be increased with this approach with only a minor decrease in anonymity."

The game will feature a visual representation of equations using boxes for variables, operations and constants. These can be manipulated by the player to solve the given equation. The game builds on Tux Math's current arithmetic exercises, bridging the gap to more abstract, algebraic thinking."
Mesos - Security and Authentication Support,twitter,İlim Uğur,"The project consists mainly of implementing authorization and authenticationsupport to Apache Mesos, making use of MIT Kerberos, so that only allowed frameworks will be able to register and submit jobs."
Netty Asynch DNS,twitter,Mohamed Bakkar,I would like to add asynchronous DNS capability (so as to avoid blocking calls using the java built-in API).
Scalding: Matrix optimizations,twitter,Tomáš Tauber,"The aim was to optimize the Matrix API layer of Twitter's Scalding library in Scala. The main optimizations were done in two areas: 1) matrix chain multiplication, 2) various operations on sparse and skewed matrices."
Create a oAuth layer,TYPO3 Association,Denys Butenko,"I like the idea of the oAuth plugin, because I think it is most needed for the project and suitable for me. I would like to implement as part of a summer internship oAuth plugin."
Fluid : Cut dependencies on Flow.,TYPO3 Association,Puja Singh,"Fluid,the template engine used by TYPO3, uses Flow as its framework. The aim of the project is to make Fluid independent of Flow,so that it can be integrated with other frameworks as well,or can work even without a framework. So,the project aims at making Fluid fully functional and standalone template engine."
FluidBoilerplate,TYPO3 Association,Jacob Floyd,"I propose that TYPO3 Neos adopt a new package type: a Boilerplate. For this GSOC project, I will create two example Boilerplate packages: Twitter Bootstrap and HTML5 Boilerplate. I will build a Boilerplate framework in a TYPO3.FluidBoilerplate package. This package will provide a RESTful api for a decoupled UI (similar to TemplaVoila). The UI will be in the TYPO3.FluidBuilder package, however I will focus more on the backend layer in TYPO3.FluidBoilerplate."
TYPO3 Flow meets Ember.js (previously named: Kickstarter for Flow/Ember.js applications),TYPO3 Association,Manuel Mitasch,"The goal of this project is to enable a loose coupling of TYPO3 Flow domain models and Ember.js data models through conventions. Therefore, a Flow-based REST API (controller, view, route part) that complies to the Ember conventions will be implemented. A scaffolding/kickstart functionality will provide the generation of Ember models from Flow model semantics. Additionally, the kickstarter will be able to generate a full prototype of all remaining client-side assets (Ember controllers, views, handlebar templates) for a basic Ember-based user interface. In short, using Flow to build great Ember apps should become very easy."
Android app for MediaWiki translation,Wikimedia,orsa,"An app for making translations in a MediaWiki site with the Translate extension, such as translatewiki.net or meta.wikimedia.org."
Bayesian Spam Filter,Wikimedia,Anubhav Agarwal,"A token(word) based bayesian spam classifier for comabting wiki spam problmes.Besides words it takes into account a lot of other factors like capital letters, punctuation marks etc. Also adding support for large wiki for concurret edits. "
Improve support for book structures,Wikimedia,Molly White,"I will improve support for wikis like Wikisource and WikiBooks, whose content is structured in a book format. I will improve the existing BookManager extension to allow these wikis to structure pages and sections of a book into an easily-navigable unit. Users will be able to enter information about the organizational structure of a book into a form, which will store the book's structure. This will then be used to (optionally) auto-generate navigation bars."
Incremental data dumps,Wikimedia,Petr Onderka,"Currently, creating a database dump of larger Wikimedia sites takes a very long time, because it's always done from scratch. Creating new dump based on previous one could be much faster, but not feasible with the current XML format. This project proposes to create a new binary format for the dumps, which would allow efficient modification of the dump, and thus creating new dump based on the previous one.Another benefit would be that this format would also allow seeking, so a user can directly access the data they are interested in. A similar format will be also created, which will allow downloading only changes since the last dump was made and applying them to previously downloaded dump."
Incremental updates for Kiwix (offline Wikipedia),Wikimedia,kiranmathewkoshy,"This project was thought up in order to make Wikipedia available to remote places without a proper internet connection. As of now, users need to download the full database every time they need to update, and this is quite cumbersome and/or impractical for a user with a slow internet connection.This project implements an incremental update feature in to the existing Kiwix software.Once finished, this would greatly benefit many schools/other institutes in developing regions of the world. It will enable them to keep a local cache of the data, which updates itself automatically."
Internationalization and Right-To-Left Support in VisualEditor,Wikimedia,Moriel Schottlender,"I propose working on a series of improvements to VisualEditor concentrating on support for RTL languages like Hebrew, Arabic, Persian and Pashto. "
jQuery.IME extensions for Firefox and Chrome,Wikimedia,Praveen Singh,"jQuery Input Method Editor is a collection of more than 150 input methods across several languages. It is the jQuery version of the input method tool, Narayam, which is used across several Wikimedia projects. Currently jQuery.IME is provided from the Wikimedia servers.This project mainly aims at:(1) Porting jQuery.IME to Firefox and Chrome extensions.(2) Providing on demand loading of input methods for different languages rather than injecting all 150+ input methods on a web page.(3) Working out a solution to update the extension from the upstream project with minimal manual effort.As these extensions would allow the user to use the input methods on any website and not just on MediaWiki enabled websites, these would be of immense help to the users."
Language Coverage Matrix Dashboard,Wikimedia,Harsh Kothari,"The Language Coverage Matrix dashboard would help automate the information about language support provided by the Language Engineering team for e.g. key maps, web fonts, translation, language selector, i18n support for gender, plurals, grammar rules. The LCM would display this information as well as provide visualization graphs of language coverage using various search criteria such as tools or languages. I will build this web based dashboard using Javascript libraries integrated with MySQL to manage the data. I found this project very useful for language engineering team since wikimedia supports more than 300 languages. This tool will help them analyse the details of various available features of individual language. The Language Engineering team can efficiently prioritize and include some missing features, that is the features which are not currently available in particular language. The overall impact of this project will lead to an efficient and enhanced user experience for Wikis.This web based dashboard will also help other products and communities for showing innumerous search results and visualization graphs for the same."
MediaWiki-Moodle Extension ,Wikimedia,Clancer,My project will allow users of MediaWiki to display information about Moodle courses. 
Mobilize Wikidata,Wikimedia,Pragun Bhutani,"My project is aimed at extending Wikidata to make it accessible on mobile devices. Setting up Wikibase with MobileFrontend shows that while MobileFrontend can be used to achieve a mobile-friendly version of WIkidata, some problems arise due to JS based UIs not rendering properly through MobileFrontend. My plan is to implement Wikibase without Javascript to make it compatible with MobileFrontend."
Pronunciation Recording Extension,Wikimedia,Rahul Maliakkal,"Wiktionary is a multilingual, web-based project to create a free content dictionary, available in 158 languages. Each word existing in the dictionary has a separate page and many words have a pronunciation file embedded into their respective page. However there are many words especially words from a particular background like Mathematics, Medicine, Physics, etc that do not have an embedded pronunciation file. Wiktionary has an interface to upload the pronunciation of words but it is complicated and time consuming. Through this extension I plan on providing a ""User-Friendly"" interface to upload the pronunciation of a word. The project on completion would be very useful to the Wiktionary Community and to the millions of people using this ""Online Free Dictionary"". "
Prototyping inline comments,Wikimedia,Richa Jain,The goal of this project is to make a prototype for an inline commenting system where a user after landing to a wiki article can make useful comments on some part of the text and other users can optionally reply back to it. This will be implemented as a separate extension. I will be using the OKFN technology available under the MIT license which provides the user with tools to annotate text. The API methods will be provided to retrieve comments and to update them.
Refactoring of Proofread Page extension,Wikimedia,Aarti Dwivedi,"Wikisource is one of the largest projects of the Wikimedia Foundation. However, its editing process is really different from Wikipedia's because the goal is to publish already existing works in the Public Domain. This process relies almost entirely on the ProofreadPage extension, which adds to mediawiki features related to scanned books : mainly, proofreading the book's text by comparing it to scanned images. As a consequence, the ProofreadPage extension is key to Wikisource's well-being.An example of the use of ProofreadPage extension is http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:Studies_of_a_Biographer_4.djvu/174&action=edit</br>The development history of the extension has been somewhat discontinuous, leading to a non-modular and difficult to extend code base. The goal of the project is two-fold:- reorganizing and refactoring the extension, making sure to make it modular, non-redundant, and documented as needed to ease future work- integrating the Visual Editor and extending it to make it compliant with the ProofreadPage extension's specific features"
Section handling in Semantic Forms,Wikimedia,Himeshi,"The Semantic Forms Extension in Mediawiki is a useful and widely used feature of MediaWiki to make semantically structured data, contained within template calls which are easy to create and edit. However at present Semantic Forms does not support structuring of wiki pages by page sections. Accomplishing this project would mean enabling administrators to define page sections in the form definition for the structure of their wiki pages. It would also allow users to add data to those defined page sections using forms in the Semantic Forms extension.The project would also extend the Page schemas extension to allow defining of page sections."
UploadWizard: Book upload customization( from ideas page),Wikimedia,Nazmul Chowdhury,The proposed book upload customization for the Extension:UploadWizard would be activated as a as a UploadWizard Campaign. This book upload customisation would make appear buttons to import books and book metadata from external sources. More information on: Wikisource:Book uploader.
VisualEditor Math Equation Plugin,Wikimedia,Jiabao Wu,"Extend the mathematical functonality of VisualEditor. This will allow users, unfamiliar with wiki-text, to insert and edit content including mathematical symbols and equations."
VisualEditor plugin for source code editing,Wikimedia,Tongbo Sui,"Plugin for VisualEditor in the areas of source code editing, providing support to insert source codes easily, allowing features such as simple grammar checking, indentation correction, and beautifying code. The VisualEditor would definitely need these features and as a programmer I feel it is necessary to have these basic functions in every possible text editor that supports source code markups."
Wikidata language fallback and conversion,Wikimedia,Liangent,"Currently Wikidata stores multilingual contents. Labels (names, descriptions etc) are expected to be written in every language, so every user can read them in their own language. This works for a static data set with labels in all language filled, but it's not the case on Wikidata. This proposal aims at resolving these issues by displaying contents from another language to users based on user preferences (some users may know more than one languages), language similarity (language fallback chain), or the possibility to do transliteration, and allow proper editing on these contents."
Implement ITextDocument in Richedit,Wine Project,Jactry Zeng,I would like to implement some functions of ITextDocument.
MSXML - Implement MSXML without libxml2,Wine Project,John Chadwick,"MSXML is currently implemented using libxml2. This is problematic in cases where libxml2 and MSXML are not compatible in behavior. As part of moving away from libxml2 incrementally, the XPath parser can be reimplemented by making use of only the MSXML DOM (therefore making it independent of the underlying DOM implementation.)"
Registry - implement merging between HKCR and HKCU\Software\Classes,Wine Project,George Stephanos,Certain keys from HKCU and HKLM should be merged and put into HKCR according to rules available on MSDN.
Improved Fuzzing,Wireshark,Sonny Tavernier,"My proposal aims to improve the efficiency and the coverage of the tests by developing a ""smart"" fuzzer heavily based on your current fuzzing script.I also propose a way to help identify duplicate coverage and distill the capture file collection used in the tests following a request from Gerald Combs."
JSONshark Project,Wireshark,Wei Dai,"In this project, we developed a web application based on tshark commands, so that users can remotely capture packets or open raw packet data files through browsers. Users may also dissect and parse the captured packets. Relevant detailed information of the packets will thus be shown in the browser. This application is composed of three parts, the front end, the Node.js back end and the wrapper based on tshark commands. The front end (index.ejs) is responsible for sending user requests, displaying the captured and parsed packets. The node.js back end (app.js and echld.js) is responsible for handling user requests by calling the wrapper and communicating with the front end in real time through socket.io module. The wrapper (echldwrapper.h .cc, jsonparser.h .cc) is implemented as a c/c++ addon module for the node.js server, so that the back end can call tshark commands as sub-processes, and output the captured packets and parsed packet information as json messages. Functions in the wrapper are general enough to be extended for the echld module in wireshark, instead of only tshark commands."

Code Revisions,WordPress,Alexander Höreth,Project to add WordPress native revisions to the theme and plugin code editors. The idea is to make use of WordPress core functionality and not adding new complexity.
Enhance Profiles.WordPress.org,WordPress,Mert Yazicioglu,"Although WordPress.org has been enhanced both design-wise and feature-wise, profiles.wordpress.org did not see much love. Being a plugin developer and a core contributor, I would personally love to interact with the other developers, without feeling the need of leaving the .org ecosystem."
JSON REST API,WordPress,Ryan McCue,"At the moment, the only real API to access WP content is the XML-RPC API. This requires a full suite of parsing tools and is less than optimal for most users. In the past, XML parsing (usually with libxml) has caused problems on mobile platforms, which are the main consumers of the API. A JSON REST API removes much of this complexity by using a simpler serialisation format (JSON) with a protocol usable by most of the web via standard HTTP verbs. "
Port WordPress for WebOS to Firefox OS,WordPress,Sayak Sarkar,"WordPress for webOS is a great app builtwith web technologies for the WebOS platform. Several new web-centric mobile platforms are springing up and it would be great for WordPress to have a presence on each. This project aims to take the webOS app and convert it to run on one of these new platforms: Firefox OS. The application's code would be developed in a manner which would allow the easy conversion of the application to other platforms as well."
WordPress mobile app for BlackBerry 10 devices,WordPress,Daniele Maio,"create a native mobile app to allow the users to access and manage their WordPress-powered blog(s) wherever they want whenever they need, without needing a pc and a browser, but just through their smartphones."
Validator.nu Java API,World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),gabor,"Validator.nu is an online service offering validation of several widely used document schemas. One of them is HTML5, the next generation of the most important markup language of the Web. Currently, the online validator does not separate the validation logic from the Web Service code, which impedes reusing the validation service outside the online validator. The goal of this project is to refactor the Validator.nu project so that the validator be a standalone reusable Java component. This will facilitate the validation of HTML5 documents, which is an important requirement for adopters of this new generation of HTML."
W3C Internationalization Checker - An API rewrite in Java,World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),Joseph J Short,"The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Internationalization (i18n) Checker aids web developers in the creation of language-sensitive web pages, embodying the W3C’s objective of “making the web world-wide”. As it stands, the PHP code that comprises the validation and summary is integrated into the logic of the web service. The purpose of this project is to bring the i18n Checker up to date with its counterpart validators by rewriting it in Java, and separating the validation logic into an API."
~JSON-LD~,World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),vikash,"Linked Data describes a method of publishing structured which can be interlinked and makes data more useful.These are not intended to serve web pages rather they are used to share information between computers so that they can read and interpret easily. RDF, designed as meta data model is and has been used for Linking Data. One of the profound examples of its use can be seen in Facebook's Open Graph. The aim of my project is to conclude the final stages of JSON-LD [JSON - Linked - Data] [based upon JSON, as the name suggests] by making Schema's, Context, Applications that show JSON to JSON-LD conversions etc. JSON-LD is a light weight JSON-Linked Data that provides context to a data."
[Ryzom] Programmable shader pipeline and material editor tool,WorldForge,dfighter,"Ryzom currently uses a renering pipeline with hardcoded shaders in shader assembly.This project aims to replace that pipeline with one that is programmable using material definitions using high level shader language. Additionally a material editor tool will be created so that materials can be easily defined and previewed.Also the current 3DS Max plugin for exporting models and materials will be updated to support the new pipeline."
Account Management Web Application With Ticketing System And Its Integegration into Ryzom App.,WorldForge,Daan Janssens," Ryzom Core needs an 'Account Management System', with all its related components regard-ing account registration. An important aspect of this account management system is the Ticket system!Because Ryzom App has some great potentials, we willintigrate the ticketing system as an App into it, in this way, users can easily start a ticket while being ingame."
CEGUI - Custom-shape drawing (vector-graphics ready) + SVG support,WorldForge,Lukas Meindl,"I would like to make CEGUI capable of rendering images defined in the SVG format. To make this happen, the core library has to be extended with an SVGImage class and the renderers have to be extended to be able to render vector graphics by generating pre-tesselated vertex-geometry shapes that can be rendered in real-time. Additionally, shaders have to be created for the different renderers, so that at least some of the gradient types, defined in the SVG standard, can be rendered using the respective fragment shaders."
Environment dependent camera animations,WorldForge,Fabien Henon,"Camera animations that are linked to character animations.With this system we can make the camera shake when a huge creature follows us for instance."
GUI navigation and visual focus,WorldForge,Tim,"The project aims at providing an easy way to enable navigation between different GUI items and their activation, besides using the mouse (e.g.: using the keyboard)."
Replace current terrain manager with Ogre terrain component,WorldForge,Samuel Kogler,"Ember currently uses PagingLandscapeSceneManager 2(PLSM2), a plugin for the Ogre 3D rendering engine which can display a Terrain by replacing the default Ogre scene manager. PLSM2 is no longer being developed and its design makes Ember inflexible. Therefore, it is desirable to switch to the new Ogre::Terrain component which is part of core Ogre and can be used independent of the SceneManager implementation."
DRM Render/Modeset Nodes,X.Org Foundation,David Herrmann,"The linux kernel provides a generic modesetting API (KMS) as part of the direct rendering manager interface (DRM). During the last years, DRM access control turned out to be difficult to manage with this setup. Therefore, this projects tries to split both apart so we can apply different access modes to each of them.As a side effect, this also allows us to provide more fine-grained and, more importantly, dynamic render/modeset node management. This is needed to allow efficient and secure compositor-stacking (eg., system compositors), off-screen rendering without a compositor, off-screen OpenCL usage and more."
Implementing GL_EXT_direct_state_access,X.Org Foundation, ,"To implement the OpenGL extension GL_EXT_direct_state_access, which adds entrypoints that allow code to query and modify state without the cumbersome query-bind-modify-rebind cycle required by vanilla GL."
Reverse engineering NVidia's performance counters and exposing them via nv_perfmon.,X.Org Foundation,Samuel Pitoiset,"The goal of this project is to reverse engineering NVidia's performance counters which are exposed through the CUDA compute profiler which uses CUpti, a high-level API. That profiler allows users to gather timing information about kernel execution and memory transfer operations. The profiler can be used to identify performance bottlenecks in multi-kernel applications or to quantify the benefit of optimizing a single kernel. The main goal of this proposal is to implement the same kind profiler for the nouveau open source driver and then extend it by adding non-compute-related signals."
Improved Database Layout,XBMC,Zachary Seymour,This proposal is to work on the proposed project idea for improving the XBMC database
Improved Support for Linux Windowing Systems,XBMC,Sam Spilsbury,"The purpose of this project will be to create window system backends todeploy XBMC on modern linux windowing systems and provide automated testssuch that the code doesn't fall into bitrot for windowing systems whichmight not be heavily used at the moment.Ideally, the project will allow xbmc to run natively when either: Directly on the linux framebuffer (eg, GBM / KMS), Via the wayland protocol on Weston, Via the Mir protocol on the Mir Compositor."
