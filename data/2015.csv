Jython: Add full gc support to JyNI (and support ctypes),Python Software Foundation,Stefan Richthofer,"JyNI is a compatibility layer with the goal to enable Jython to use native CPython extensions like NumPy. It already supports a fair part of Python's C-API and is for instance capable of running basic TKinter code. A main show-stopper for a production-release is its lack of garbage collection. I propose a concept how native gc can be emulated for JyNI in a way that is almost 100% compatible with CPython's native gc. With gc-support given, I assume support for ctypes to be straight forward."
"Kivy-Designer development, mobile integration and project maintainer",Python Software Foundation,Aron Barreira Bordin,"When developing any kind of projects, teams seek for the most productive, easy and powerful tools.

pgmpy: Adding feature for working with state names,Python Software Foundation,Deepak Garg,"Right now pgmpy doesn’t have the feature to add state names for random variables. Therefore user’s have to work with some randomly assigned state indexes for the states of the random variables. In the case of huge networks it really get difficult to keep a trace of the indexes of the states. So, this project would focus on implementing a framework that would enable users to work entirely with state names."

PyPy: Exploit superword parallelism on Array and NumPy traces,Python Software Foundation,Richard Plangger,"The goal of this project is to enhance the trace optimizer of PyPy. By definition NumPy arrays are unboxed, homogeneously typed and continuous in memory (despite certain exceptions). The same is true for the array module in the standard library. The new optimizer will use this opportunity and exploit a SIMD instruction set (such as SSE,AVX) present on modern CISC processors (e.g. x86). This should lead to enhanced execution speed for arithmetic intensive applications that run on top of PyPy."
PyPy: Work on Python 3.x support,Python Software Foundation,Manuel Jacob,PyPy is almost feature-compatible with Python 2.7. Where it's lacking is Python 3.x support. PyPy cannot provide compatibility with Python versions newer than 3.2. This is one of the reasons why PyPy's Python 3.x support hasn't seen much adoption among users. Missing adoption also means that there's little interest in contributing to PyPy's 3.x support and it's getting worse because Python 3.x is constantly evolving. A concentrated effort is needed to break this cycle.

Rewrite of the Icecast Stream Directory API(XIPH),Xiph.Org Foundation,Marco Flowers,Building a REST JSON api for the Icecast Stream directory which will allow for more efficient use of the directory by Icecast clients. Will also rewrite the directory website to consume the new api.
Valentin's proposal to Icecast about Let's encrypt for Icecast,Xiph.Org Foundation,Valentin,"Similar to how Lets encrypt already works for Apache make it configure IceCast for SSL without much manual user interaction.Implement this via a letsencrypt plugin.As a second goal update the libshout python bindings."
Add support for DNSSEC to Smack via MiniDNS,XMPP Standards Foundation,Marvin W,"MiniDNS is a DNS client library, which allows Android Apps and Java programs to resolve DNS resource records (RR). Adding support for DNSSEC would be the logical next step to improve the security of the software using MiniDNS. Since MiniDNS runs also on JavaSE runtimes, i.e. it is not an Anroid exclusive library, all applications using it would also become DNSSEC enabled. Once MiniDNS is able to perform DNSSEC, it should be used in smack-resolver-minidns for DNS resolution."
Add support for XMPP Serverless Messaging (XEP-174) to Smack,XMPP Standards Foundation,Ishan Khanna,Through this project I propose to Implement Serverless Messaging into Smack. That would allow XMPP Clients to communicate with each other over a local area network or the same WiFi network without the need for a server.
Axolotl support for Conversations,XMPP Standards Foundation,strb,I want to extend Conversations to support axolotl as an end-to-end encryption mechanism that works well with multi-device mobility.

Multi-account support in Swift,XMPP Standards Foundation,Daniel Baczynski,Sometimes people have multiple accounts on different servers and would like to connect to them at the same time. It is possible to run several instances of Swift and log to each account but this is ugly and uncomfortable way. The project aims to create pleasing user interface for multi-account actions and ensure proper performance when connected with several servers.
"Prototyping tools, for Internet of Things",XMPP Standards Foundation,Adhish Singla,"Internet of Things(IoT) is expected to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine communications (M2M) and covers a variety of protocols, domains, and applications. We aim at making Tools and create a binding between SleekXMPP and various Devices like Netatmo,intel edisonetc. which can be controlled by means of Client Applications. Also to check compatibility between Devices, i.e. if they can exchange Data between each other."
