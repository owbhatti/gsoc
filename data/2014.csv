JIT Optimization with Annotation Support,Dr. Memory,Byron,"The DynamoRIO cache consistency strategy is not the most efficient for dynamically generated code. To optimize: (1) implement an annotation framework similar to Valgrind's, allowing the target app to specify dynamic code regions; (2) use this information in the optimization from issue #1114: writes to pre-flushed regions are redirected to a writable ""view"" of the same target address range; (3) extend this optimization to all apps by inferring dynamic code regions from observed app behavior."
Run 32-bit Applications in 64-Bit Mode to Improve Dr. Memory Performance,Dr. Memory,Piyus Kedia,Memory tracing tools has higher overhead due to the instrumentation code around actual code which might use temporary registers. In such cases instrumented code save and restore the temporary registers. If we run 32-bit applications in 64-bit mode we can use extra registers in 64-bit mode which do not exists for 32-bit machine as temporary register which will definitely improve performance.

Algorithms for Finding Equilibria of General Player Games,Gambit: Software Tools for Game Theory,Christian Pelissier,"A recently launched web-based extension of the Gambit project, Game Theory Explorer (GTE), aims to provide a lightweight yet powerful tool for game theory. Given that GTE is still in development, it is missing several key features, namely the ability to represent and solve games with more than two players. Accordingly, we focus on extending the interface of Game Theory Explorer to allow for more than two players as well as researching and implementing algorithms for solving general-player games."
Improve OO encapsulation of StrategicSupport class,Gambit: Software Tools for Game Theory,John Benjamin,"This is a project to improve the general Gambit framework for implementing a Game Theory solution algorithm. An efficient game solving algorithm should never search for solutions over a support with one or more strictly dominated strategies. The Gambit framework captures this concept for any algorithm to build upon, but only indirectly. This project will improve upon the framework so that a C++ StrategicSupport object is available to algorithms as a complete representation of possible equilibra."
Generic conversion interface between various disk templates,Ganeti,Dimitris Bliablias,"Ganeti provides the ability to create instances choosing between variousdisk templates.

This project aims to improve the overall visualization and also support the new metrics supported by NVIDIA management library"
RRDtool data access from data analysis frameworks,Ganglia,Plamen Dimitrov,"Packages like R/Weka are very powerful and proven in their ability to efficiently analyze data using a variety of techniques. Dumping the contents of an rrd file to XML (with rrddump) and csv (http://code.google.com/p/rrd2csv/) is possible. While csv can be easily read into any of these tools, being able to directly read the binary data and not exporting it to anintermediate format first would be a lot more efficient and time-saving."
Coarray support in GNU GFortran,GCC - GNU Compiler Collection,Alessandro Fanfarillo,"The Coarray syntax adds a few specific keywords to the Fortran language and leaves the user free to utilize the usual array syntax to realize parallel programs. Having the Coarray support inside the GNU GFortran compiler will bring benefits to every user which needs to produce parallel software without being an expert parallel programmer."
Concepts Separate Checking,GCC - GNU Compiler Collection,Blzut3,I propose to implement features related to the separate checking of templates in the c++-concepts branch of GCC. The goal is to provide an initial level of opt-in support that allow template definitions to be checked against their constraints.

Git configuration API improvements,Git,Tanay Abhra,"Currently git_config() uses a callback mechanism and file rereads for config values. Due to this approach, it is not uncommon for the configuration to be parsed several times during the run of a git program. Instead of using the above method, we will construct a in-memory cache of the config file the first time a config value is queried for. The callbacks will be rewired to use the new API functions provided for efficient lookups from the internal cache. After this, new features can be added."
Line options for git rebase --interactive,Git,Fabian,"On their ideas page for possible Google Summer of Code projects, the Git community proposes the addition of option arguments to the commands available on git-rebase-interactive todo lists, such as `squash --signoff f1a5c00`, which adds a ``Signed-off-by'' line to the commit message.During GSoC, I would like to refactor the git-rebase-interactive shell script such that it admits todo list commands with argument lists of varying length instead of solely nullary commands."

GNU LibffCall - AvCall and Callback Cleanup,GNU Project,Ishpuneet Singh,"My GSoC project focuses on two libraries of LibffCall : Avcall and Vcall. Source code of the libraries is pretty abandoned and no proper implementation of autotools. Separate script exist for linking the platform specific code to C, which have to be updated by a single configure script. Man pages are not properly maintained and scripted. Implementation of proper GNU standards as the existing code is a mess. Merging of assemble code into a single file for specific platform needs to be done."
GNU LibffCall - Refactoring Trampoline and Vacall library,GNU Project,Ashish Goyal,"GNU LibffCall Code is written in C & assembly language and there is no technical documentation regarding it, which makes extremely difficult to understand the code. As there is assembly code for different platforms so there is use of different instruction sets, opcode’s and labels which make it a programmer's nightmare. So there is an immediate need of refactoring the code for helping programmers to understandthe code for future reference. "

This project will also perform model based identification of strong gravitational lenses in Images."
Alternate transport for U1DB sync protocol,LEAP Encryption Access Project,Indradhanush Gupta,"HTTP, although an excellent mode of communication is poor for message transfers. It uses persistent connections which unnecessarily hog up network resources for messaging applications like the sync process used by LEAP Encryption Access Project. The implementation uses U1DB, which provides no alternative transport other than HTTP. Thus it's imperativethat an alternate transport be used for such applications. Also it should let users select specific documents to sync and recover from a crash."
Integrate obfsproxy with LEAP,LEAP Encryption Access Project,Alexandros Afentoulis,"obfsproxy is a python framework for obsfuscating traffic between a client and a server. obfsproxy was initially designed and currently used with Tor software as a tool to obfuscate Tor traffic and bypass censorship tools. obfsproxy supports multiple protocols which specify how the underlying traffic will be transformed, these are called pluggable transports. Apart from using obfsproxy with Tor, it can be used to camouflage other types of traffic such as VPN or SSH connections."

 Implement wxGraphicsContext using Direct2D,wxWidgets,Alexandru Pana,"Currently, wxGraphicsContext is implemented using GDI+ under Windows. GDI+ seems, unfortunately, to be abandoned by Microsoft and has a lot of problems including generally very poor performance and horrible text rendering, especially at small font sizes.Since Windows 7 (and Vista with updates installed) another solution is available: Direct2D. This project would consist of implementing a new wxGraphicsContext backend using this new API, and its companion DirectWrite for the text output."
Improve wxQt port and wxPython for Android proof of concept,wxWidgets,Mariano Reingart,"A previous GSoC project has created the basics of a wxWidgets port to Qt. The task for this year would be to make this port really usable and complete the missing parts, suitable for developing small applications with it, bringing the wxQt port up to current wxWidgets standards, updated to Qt 5.2.As a proof of concept to explore the capabilities and limits of the mobile environment and rapid application development, a minimal prototype of wxPython using wxQt for Andorid could be developed."

Posting list encoding improvements,Xapian Search Engine Library,ShangtongZhang,"In Xapian, storing a list( post list ) for a specific termis an important part.Current approach is not so ideal, so I come up with some ways to improve the encoding of the post list.Linear searching is used in some part of Xapian now, I'm going to replace it with a skip list or hashing.Storing a list ( position list ) of the positions where a term appear in a document is also of great importance. I'd like to use dynamic encoding in place of the interpolative encoding. "

Lazy Restore Using Memory Paging,Xen Project,Dushyant Behl,"VM save/restore functionality is one of the most commonly used in Clouds andVirtualization platforms. The current implementation of VM save/restore in Xenresults in loading the entire memory image of the VM from the save file which inturns slows down the entire process. I plan to improve this process by introducingthe concept of Lazy restore and using memory paging."

Parallel xenwatch kthread,Xen Project,Tülin İzer,"I am a past OPW intern (round 6). During my internship, I worked to parallelize the x86 boot process. This meant understanding and modifying very low level bring up code. I contributed 34 patches to the 3.11 kernel. I would like to keep contributing to Linux kernel and I am interested in parallel xenwatch kthread project. I took operation systems, distributed systems and applications classes last year, so I have basic understanding on locks. I think I am qualified for this project."
 Xen Hypervisor-- HVM per-event-channel interrupts,Xen Project,hanyandong,Modify Xen to allow each event channel to be bound to a separate interrupt (the association being controlled by the PV drivers in the guest) to allow separate event channel interrupts to be handled by separate vCPUs. There should be no modifications required to the guest OS interrupt logic to support this (as there is with the current Linux PV-on-HVM code) as this will not be possible with a Windows guest.
