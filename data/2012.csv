Exchangeable Encodings for SOS - extension support WaterML2,52°North Initiative for Geospatial Open Source Software GmbH,Alexander Kmoch,"The 52°North SOS implements a subset of the O&M data format, because O&M is too flexible to be supported completely. It would be a good alternative, if users could just implement a simple encoding (for example to support their own CSV or JSON data format) and upload a compiled jar file to the SOS with a browser-based user interface. Then a client selects the newly available response format to retrieve the data in a new format. As an extension it would be very useful to researchers and data maintainers in the hydrological and meteorological domain to have the SOS server deliver WaterML2.0 encoded time-series.Based on the SOS adminstrator project, the desired encodings could be prepared as .jar-files and added via a web frontend."
GIS link to the Web of Things,52°North Initiative for Geospatial Open Source Software GmbH,Sidhant,"The project titled “GIS link to the Web of Things” envisions a world in which everyday devices and objects are linked by fully integrating them into the World Wide Web. Imagine, a scenario in which thousands of sensors spread over the seven seas can be controlled via any location on the earth. Although, one would rightly argue that such system are already in place, but what we are lacking is an interoperable API which can answer http request to the sensors, and its equivalent GIS software at the client/access end. Implementing the GeoServices REST API directly on the sensor platform would provide just that. "
On-demand transformation of Open Street Map Data into common GIS formats ,52°North Initiative for Geospatial Open Source Software GmbH,Sarah Harvey,"Open Street Map (OSM) is a valuable and free source of geographical data backed by a large number of volunteers mapping the world. However, the usage of this data is not trivial. The central website offers only a ’raw’ data format. GIS systems have their own dataformats. An on-demand transformation step is missing which can be filled by (interoperable) Web Services such as the 52North Web Processing Service (WPS).Project result: An addition to the 52North WPS to transform OSM data in various GIS formats on demand."
SOS Administrator,52°North Initiative for Geospatial Open Source Software GmbH,Shubham Sachdeva,"Deploying SOS on a server is quite a complex process as of now. Also, data administration tasks such as Read/Update/Delete operations on database and changing configuration settings is not very user friendly. After this project has been completed, SOS will have a web-based user friendly automatic installer and a SOS administration, which will make configuring SOS very easy and intuitive and all data administrative tasks could be done at one place."

Improve JSON support in Apache Axis2 with google-gson java library,Apache Software Foundation,Shameera Rathnayaka,"According to the existing JSON support in Apache Axis2/Java, it deals with badgerfish[1] format of the JSON object which is an XML representation of JSON object. In the server side it converts that badgerfish stringto the relevant XML format and use it similarly as a normal XML SOAP message. As described in Axis2 documentation[1] it partially supports mapped format which isanother XML representation of JSON object too. But this JSON support can be improved to support pure JSON objects without using any format to covert it into a XML, as JSON is a light weighted alternative to XML. Therefore existing JSON support doesn't expose its advantages at all. Here I propose a solution to improve the existing JSON support of Axis2 with some limitations by using google-gson [2] library which is a rich library to convert a JSON string to a Java object and vice-versa. As this is also released under Apache license, using this library we can improve JSON support in Axis2 to overcome above problem."

Statistical Inference Operator on Pig(List Operators) ,Apache Software Foundation,Allan Avendaño,"The use of statistical inference methods on a set of data provides the most basic analytical intuition of a how the collection of data could be summarized, for instance, a sequential identifier according to a specific order, density among the elements of a particular subgroups, distribution over partitions and so on. These functionalities imply efficiency and reliability on operations performed on large datasets.Currently, statistical operations on large data sets can be done with SQL instructions, by means of DBMS or some other frameworks based-on SQL sentences; it is done through countless and complicated nested queries, implying performance concerns to non-related users with SQL.On a high-level layer, it is also possible to have a functional implementation of these statistical operations tightly attached to the performance of each language and to portability concerns among different DBMS.On an intermediate layer, is also possible to recreate these methods through a sequence of operators on Pig, without being too complex like SQL statements and mainly with the advantage of running over a distributed platform.On this sense, one feasible improvement on Pig is to provide a set of named operators that implements the statistical inference methods with a standard performance level. This improvement becomes a functional integration to experienced users on statistical frameworks, without knowing SQL or any programming techniques.https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-2353"

WSDL customization framework for Axis2 and stabilize WSDL 2.0 features.,Apache Software Foundation,Ranjana Prasad,"Apache Axis2 is an open source framework which acts as an engine for Web Services, SOAP and WSDL. It supports automatic generation and publishing of both WSDL 1.1 and WSDL 2.0 documents at runtime. As it stands, currently Axis2 does not provide any API to customize and control the behavior of WSDL generation. The main objective of this proposal is to provide an easy to use WSDL customization framework for both WSDL 1.1 and WSDL 2.0. As of yet, Axis2 is the only known web service implementation that supports for WSDL 2.0.But Axis2’s WSDL 2.0 features are not up-to-date as WSDL 1.1 features. Some of the issues identified are,Not supporting the use of “useOriginalWsdl” parameterNot supporting the WSDLSupplier interface and Not supporting WS-Policy publishing etc.Addressing the above mentioned limitations is another significant goal of this proposal. Other than these two goals, GSOC project idea pages have mentioned number of issues as optional tasks. Addressing some of those issues is also included in the scope of this proposal."

Python bindings rewrite,ASCEND,Shaun,"Now ASCEND is mainly use the PYGTK to present the GUI. But the base of ASCEND is built upon C/C++ which provide efficiencies. While it is hard to code python modules from scratch, ASCEND chose SWIG to bridge C/C++ and Python which is used by PYGTK. In ASCEND, we use SWIG to build a core PYTHON extension module called “ascpy” which is the adapter between the core calculation engine (libascend.so) and PYGTK-based user interface. This core adapter is mainly described by a SWIG interface file which currently contains lots of C++ style wrappers which make this SWIG interface file too long and not so easy for understanding. So the target is to makes these SWIG interface files “leaner and meaner”. This target can be achieved by clearing the C++ style wrappers in SWIG interface files and replacinge them with C wrappers contained by several SWIG interface files. The other possible way is to use CYTHON rewriting the interface between C/C++ and PYTHON. Anyway, no matter which method we choose, we should move on to make the GUI layer still works well because we actually changed the core adapter for PYTHON to use the core calculation engine."

Simplifying and extending the LuaAI subsystem,Battle For Wesnoth,Nephro,"Right now, the LuaAI system is in a state, where it can be used for artificial intelligence system development for Battle for Wesnoth campaigns, but it's usage is quite complicated and requires effort to get the system off the ground and make it run. To simply to launch a campaign with an empty LuaAI(by empty, I mean, not doing anything) a UMC developer is required to write a couple dozens of lines of code(not even mentioning the bugs that he will encounter on the way). While it seems, that we could simply hide the boilerplate code in a template or behind a macro, the situation is a bit more sophisticated(Later I will describe that in more detail). Instead of running away from this problem, I will work towards an elegant solution, creating an effective back-end system, and a clean user development environment."

A Distributed Architecture to Stream Twitter and Sina Weibo Microblog Posts,Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University,Ross,"This project comprises two parts.For the first third of the summer, I will implement a core architecture for streaming Twitter data, detecting Tweets related to censorship, and extracting the URLs or domain names that are censored.For the remaining two-thirds of the summer, I will focus on three extension goals. First, I will develop a semi-automated learning algorithm that updates the follow and track parameters on each stream on a daily basis in order to capture more censorship-related Tweets. Second, I will duplicate the Twitter architecture for Sina Weibo. I can implement the technical model quickly, but I will need to consult language experts to ensure that I sample the microblog stream correctly. Third, I will extend Herdict's goal of crowdsourcing censorship monitoring by developing a web form similar to the Herdict Reporter test form, which allows users to test whether sites are censored in their region.The technology stack includes Python, MongoDB, Redis, and Ruby on Rails."

Implicit to NURBS conversion,BRL-CAD,Wu Jianbang,"At present, BRL-CAD has implemented lots of geometric primitives in an implicit form, but when it comes to interactive shaded displays and conversion to other formats, the disadvantages of implicit primitives come out. So we need a conversion to NURBS bundary representations. Lots of primitives have already been implemented as NURBS, but some are not robust and some still need to be improved. Besides, some are still missing. This summer, if I'm accepted, I'm going to accomplish the goal of converting all (if needed) implicit primitives to NURBS, including fixing the bugs and correcting the errors existing now, and adding new conversions that have not been implemented yet. Finally, I'd like to build a converter that can walk a CSG tree and convert the implicit primitives in the tree altogether to their NURBS form. The original implementation in BRL-CAD is a good starting point, and I will take the current routines of BRL-CAD. "
Package Library Extensions,BRL-CAD,Popescu Andrei ,"The Package Library Extensions project can be split in three parts. First one consists of implementing a testing framework. Parameters tested could include speed, delay, corruption and package loss as well as a general record of this parameters for different package sizes. Packages passed around will be compared md5sum in order to ensure consistency is maintained.I have used the “gettimeofday()”time stamp difference to simulate a package timer. When a package timer expires the package is resent, the lost package count is increased and the timer is reset. This would be a very basic way of obtaining loss rate (lost packages / total packages sent).Performance bottlenecks should be detectedwhen using the above stated tests. For example, if we implement a Cyclic redundancyi check field in our package header on a very fast network there is a direct loss in performance. It is easier to resend the package that hasn't been received than to check each package.Having the above stated two fixed user callbacks will be added. Adding callbacks should make the program more flexible allowing user to choose between various situations. As well as enable a better error-detection."
Visualizing Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG),BRL-CAD,Cristina Precup,"BRL-CAD already offers the possibility of generating geometry hierarchies corresponding to .g databases. These can be eventually interpreted through images. However, the purpose of this project is to provide more than this: an interactive graph editor that allows the user to modify the .g database by interacting with its displayed graph.In Constructive Solid Geometry a hierarchy is shaped as a tree which is in fact a directed acyclic graph. Thus an automatic graph layout API would be useful for representing the hierarchical structure of the .g databases.The visual layout will be built with interactive Tcl/Tk widgets. It will use graph algorithms in altering the graph structure as well as the .g geometric structure, as the user modifies the visualized graph.In the end, this graph based visualization should be part of BRL-CAD's model editing tools MGED and Archer."
Volume and Centroid Functions for Primitives,BRL-CAD,Chris Dueck,"Currently, most primitives in BRLCAD do not have volume, centroid, or surface area functions.

I propose the implementation of a radiation transport algorithm with the Geant4 toolkit using Graphics Processing Units (GPU). GPUs are highly parallel SIMD chips which have been shown to give speedups of several orders of magnitude in many applications. The most accurate method, namely the Monte Carlo method for simulation can greatly benefit from the use of a GPU implementation in terms ofspeed or number of events simulated. I will write macros for certain parts ofGeant4 to allow for the simulation of Gamma particles on a GPU. I will also compare this new parallel implementation with the existing one in terms of speedup, accuracy and try to address potential bottlenecks. "

Typed Racket is an example of adding a satisfying type system to an existing dynamically typed language, while preserving programming idioms and supporting interaction with untyped code. We will test the generality of ideas used in Typed Racket, such as Non-Uniform Variable Arity Polymorphism (typing complex variable arity functions like 'map') andoccurrence typing (a type inference strategy).There are also other potentially novel problems to be solved/found, some are detailed in this draft research proposal for Typed Clojure.Typed Racket is divided into two main parts: a type system and a system managing interaction across module boundaries (eg. using typed code from untyped). This project will concentrate on adding a static type system to Clojure."

These language models are constructed by using machine learning algorithms on very large text corpora. Performance of the model is closely related to the amount and style of text data. Obtaining large amount of data for a certain domain to increase performance of the model is an expensive task, as domain-specific spoken text corpora is generally sparse. Using automatic means to extract additional text from the World Wide Web is a popular approach for solving this problem.In this project, a web crawler that extracts additional language model training data from the web for a given domain was implemented."

For example, the OPC UA “tree” (information model) is build based on zones with datapoints as lead nodes. Methods of the leaf nodes (datapoints) allow data access. The MOST database (datapoints, zones, etc.) is abstracted with a Java framework (DatapointCtrl, ZoneCtrl, etc.). By providing an OPC UA Server toolkit and a Java abstraction layer for building data (datapoints, zones, etc.), implementation is (in the best case) simplified to “connect” building information."

Data Visualization of Gene-Disease Links Using Graphical Networks,Crowdsourcing Biology,Karthik,"I intend to visualize gene-disease links by generating graphical networks by using the Cytoscape Web(http://cytoscapeweb.cytoscape.org/) on the web platform. I intend to use Flash because of the low processing-high performance quality of Adobe Flash. Cytoscape Web uses javascript to dynamically manipulate the Flash object thus, providing both the speed and performance of Flash as well as the dynamic nature of data manipulation using javascript.The interface will be designed in a way to avoid cumbersome navigation through a huge graph of data. There will be options to set the size of the chart as well as zoom and search options to navigate around the graph with ease.The data for the visualization will be obtained using the powerful semantic query search of Gene Wiki+. I have already gone through the API at http://genewikiplus.org/api.php?action=ask.For eg, http://genewikiplus.org/api.php?action=ask&q=Cancer contain XML data regarding Cancer. This XML data will be visualized using graph networks.Features I intend the interface to have at the end of my project1)	Movable nodes representing the specific disease and the associated genes, which can be positioned according to the biologist's needs. Clicking of these nodes will retrieve information regarding the term and will be displayed alongside the interface using Ajax and the semantic query search.2)	Color coded connections representing various relationships.3)	Exporting of the graphical network at any point as an image for further use by the biologist.4)	Options to add various nodes and connections based on the biologist's needs in which case further data regarding the relationship will be obtained and displayed using Ajax.5)	Options to delete nodes and connections and to vary size of the panel as seen fit by the biologist.6)	Suggestions regarding relationships and addition of nodes to the biologist by dynamically analyzing the nodes on the interface.7)	To negate the need of a textbox based search as currently present at http://genewikiplus.org/wiki/Special:Ask."

Automated reports are very important for tracking, progress and a clear result, and without voting democratic process can not be made.As an active contributor to civil society in my country I have a good idea how these processes should be designed, and why they are so important.I also have a special interest in creating a system that guarantees that the emitted vote is true, since that kind of system can find it's use in many other applications too: independent research of public opinion as the most important and the most needed one, since a good transparent algorithm can add a little more credibility to online voting and research, much needed in countries where the research is mostly one from one central and not so transparent place.This project makes a synthesis of the two things I love doing: coding and politics. I am an activist, a youth political columnist and I am on the constant lookout for contributing to democracy in my country, it sure needs some. As I, together with my fellow citizens have identified the need for a project like this in my county, and even made a draft some time ago.

Kernel level file integrity checker,FreeBSD,Efstratios Karatzas,This project will focus on providing file integrity checking capabilities to pefs. The file integrity checker will compare cryptographic checksums offiles against a static signed checksum list at access time. The files are thought to be immutable and use of securelevel will guarantee that lower filesystems will protect those files. Securelevel will be extended to only permit execution of files with immutable flag set.
Parallelization in The FreeBSD Ports Collection and pkgng utility,FreeBSD,Alexander Pronin,"The FreeBSD Ports Collection has been a primary system for building and installing software on FreeBSD since FreeBSD 1.0. Nevertheless, it does not provide a safe way for building several ports simultaneously. Port’s dependencies are built sequentially. To maintain the system in consistent state while building several ports it is necessary to prevent concurrent access to shared files and directories from multiple processes. My approach is based on lock files, that serve both as barriers and critical section triggers for several concurrent processes. An important aspect of my project is dealing with various failures and unexpected terminations of port’s build process to avoid any deadlock situations and inconsistent state of the ports system. Firstly, my changes to the ports framework allow safe way to build and install several ports at the same time. Secondly, I designed a convenient approach for parallel port’s dependencies builds. The main aim of this project is to make system updates faster and easier. My modifications to the ports collection allow multicore servers to use all its potential both by installing several ports and several port’s dependencies simultaneously. Same goes for the Tinderbox and pointyhat systems used by port committers. Another benefit of my project is package building with pkgng, since the build systems can build packages in parallel."

Re-enginer the wheel: a rejuvenation of BSD callout(9) and timer facilities,FreeBSD,Davide Italiano,"In all the BSD kernels, timers are provided using the callout(9) facility, which allows a function to be registered in order to be called at a future time. Right now, FreeBSD can't handle timeouts less then 2/HZ and precision less then 1/HZ. According to some recent tests, other OSes can do it much better.Some consumers may need better resolution, and this is important in lots of applications, e.g. allow faster TCP recovery in case of error or package loss, or real-time applications."

Improve the OLSRd mDNS plug-in ,freifunk,Halino,"The OLSRd mDNS plug-in allows the distribution of mDNS (multicast DNS i.e. avahi/bonjour/zeroconf) messages over an OLSR network. This is substantially achieved by sniffing for mDNS packets on the final users' networks (usually HNA networks), encapsulating them inside OLSR protocol messages, exploiting OLSR native message transfer mechanisms, and decapsulating the mDNS packets at all the other end users' networks. The plug-in has been developed by ninux.org members, however we would like to address some important issues that have arised during deployment: loops. If two mDNS plug-in enabled OLSR routers are attached to the same HNA network, then mDNS packets will loop back and forth between the two, also flooding the whole OLSR network. For the moment the temporary solution to this problem is to enable the plug-in on one router at a time on the same HNA. A real solution to the problem would be the following: usually mDNS packets have a TTL != 1, so: capture only mDNS packets with TTL != 1 when decapsulating mDNS packets, set TTL = 1 where TTL is the IP Time-to-live field capture rate. mDNS packets are incapsulated into OLSR messages, which in turn are contained in OLSR packets that are sent at the wireless basic rate (i.e. 1 or 2 Mbps) over the whole network. Thus a big amount of mDNS captured packets in a small time can slow down the whole network. A solution to this is to add a plug-in configuration option to set the maximum packet capture rate."

The benefit of the pagination over continuous scrolling would be spatial memory of where launchers are.Add keyboard navigation to windows and apps views. This would increase the speed at which users can traverse these views, and has been a much requested feature."
Proposal to upgrade the UI of Gcalctool,GNOME,Gopal Krishnan,"The main goal of this project is upgrade the UI from its current look to a look that is more reflective of the black, white and grey colour set used throughout GNOME. This will not only create a unified experience throughout GNOME, but will make it much more pleasant for a user to use.the base code from the original Fortran translated coding into one that has the various bugs fixed and at the same time changes the UI to one that reflects a more elegant and appealing UI. This is especially important for users to continue to use this application and not abandon it for a potentially better application that may be out there.For the UI change, I will take inspiration from this page: https://live.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Calculator wherethere is already an image showing the relevant art and the ideal new UI for the application. In addition to this UI change, an optional goal would be to redo the base Fortran translated code by taking inspiratio from the bugs that are mentioned here: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=product%3A%22gcalctool%22+and the idea is that by fixing these bugs and changing the UI, there will be a dramatic usability increase. Finally, C and GTK+ will be used to do this from a coding perspective. "

[HURD] Disk I/O Performance Tuning ,GNU Project,Maksym Planeta,"The most obvious reason for the Hurd feeling slow compared to mainstream systems like GNU/Linux, is a low I/O system performance, in particular very slow hard disk access.The reason for this slowness is lack and/or bad implementation of common optimization techniques. One of them is clustered page reading. This technique is base on idea that usually not only one page in file is read. That's why to minimize moving of disk head several pages which stand one by one are read at once, although only one page was asked."
"automake - non-hostile fork ""Automake-NG"" to exploit more features of GNU make",GNU Project,Stefano Lattarini,"The primary target of this project is to enable Automake-generated Makefiles to exploit more features of GNU make.This project plans to build upon the already existing (but still in its early infancy) ""Automake-NG"" fork of Automake, which generates Makefiles targeted to GNU make only."

GNU Octave: Least-Squares Spectral Analysis,GNU Project,Ben Lewis,"Least-squares spectral analysis is a method of fitting frequency data to a set of sinusoidal functions, similar to Fourier series; unlike Fourier series, though, LSSA minimizes extraneous long-period terms that can creep into a Fourier analysis. This is a powerful tool that should be added to Octave (thus its presence on the wishlist.)"
GNU Radio - DRM receiver,GNU Project,Felix Wunsch,"The purpose of this project is to implement a DRM Receiver for GNU Radio. DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) is a standard that is used for digital HF broadcasting (High Frequency: from 0.3 to 30 MHz). Because of the interesting physical electromagnetic wave properties of HF channels, DRM transmissions can be used for global communications. A GNU Radio DRM receiver would hence be of use for anyone anywhere in the world interested in radio communications.An upcoming extension of DRM, DRM+, uses VHF/UHF broadcasting (Very High Frequency: 30 - 300 MHz and Ultra High Frequency: 300 - 3000 MHz), that might well replace analog FM broadcasting in the long run. A starting point for development is the existing code base of the DREAM project. Porting this code to GNU Radio will yield many signal processing blocks that are necessary in any communication system and will allow easy extension and improvement of the standard. For example, a global data communication link could be created with GNU Radio by replacing the payload with IP packets."
GNU Radio: Extend and improve filter design components,GNU Project,Sreeraj R,"Digital filter is one of the inevitable signal processing blocks in any DSP system.

kawa - Common Lisp support,GNU Project,Charles Turner,"The Kawa project has a small subset of Common Lisp (CL) syntax implemented. It supports a much larger subset of CL concepts, however. The aim of this project is to further enhance the CL support by providing more syntactical forms and gluing the current CL concepts togheter. I also plan to support CL docstrings and time-permitting an automatic Javadoc generation facility."
LilyPond - improve Lyrics support,GNU Project,Janek Warchoł,"LilyPond support for lyrics (words that are sung to the melody) is currently similar to that of the two market leaders (Finale and Sibelius).I will add advanced lyric positioning functions: syllables will be automatically moved to avoid ambiguities in interpretation and faciliate easier sight reading.Lyric syllables will no longer cause disturbances in note spacing - instead of moving notes to fit lyrics, lyrics will adapt their position to allow for the optimal note spacing."
Org-mode – Let Org-mode synchronize with online bug-tracking and todo-list services.,GNU Project,aaptel,"There's currently no convenient way to manage services like Redmine, Bugzilla or GitHub issue tracking system in Org-mode. Org-mode already handles TODO-list pretty well, but there's no synchronization functionality for TODO-list services such as Toodledo or Google Tasks. The goal of the project is to let Org-mode import and export to these kind of services in a generic way so that new services can be added easily later on."
recutils – Add support for indexes,GNU Project,Michał Masłowski,The aim of the project is to make queries over big recfiles faster by using a binary index storing a mapping of values of specified keys to records.The index will be completely optional and will be ignored if the recfile was modified later than specified in the index.The indexed fields will be specified in the record descriptors and the index will be built (initially or after a change to the recfile) offline by user's request.
Reimplement gnulib-tool in Python,GNU Project,Dmitriy Selyutin,"gnulib-tool is the developer tool that collects modules from gnulib and stores them in the source code of a package. It is currently written as a shell script; this leads to limited maintainability and slow execution speed. The task is to rewrite it in Python. This will make the code more maintainable and faster. Required skills: Experience writing code in an object-oriented programming language (such as Java, C#, not necessarily Python). In this project, you can learn Python on the fly or broaden your experience with Python."

Implementation of most common mobility models with random failing integration. ,Google Open Source Programs Office,Boris Sieklik,"Demand for Wireless technologies has increased over the years, thus mobile devices have become a general necessity for everyday life. In order to provide more realistic simulation of wireless networks there is a need for developers to create a mechanism of simulating movements of wireless (mobile) users. These mechanisms are called mobility models. In my project I will program (implement) the most common mobility models into the Java open-source code. Furthermore, mobile nodes can often fail while present in mobile system. The goal of this project is to build fully controllable environment with ability to simulate both mobility models and failures of the nodes."
Import To/From XML,Grassroots DICOM,Nakull Gupta,"This project aims to implement a tool for converting data in DICOM to XML files and vice versa.To achieve the conversion to XML files we will have to make a DTD(Document Type Definition) or an XSD (XML Scheme Definition).After some deliberation I have decided upon using an XSD as it can capture the varied DICOM datatypes and provides a more effective solution than DTD's.The tool will also have a properly defined interface that will allow users to specify various options, set parameters, define output layout etc.This tool will thus add a new facet to GDCM's functionality and allow users to view DICOM data in XML files, as well as execute XQueries on them."
Improve OpenJPEG2000 Encoding Decoding Time,Grassroots DICOM,Aditya Deshpande,"The goal is to incorporate a GPU accelerated compression/decompression of JPEG2000 stream in GDCM. Along with the massively parallel architecture like GPU, the SIMD functionality of the multi-core CPUs (MMX, PThreads or OpenMP) can also be used for acceleration."

Audio mixing and video compositing in GES,GStreamer,Volodymyr Rudyj,Aim of this project is implementing audio mixing and video compositing in GES library so it can be used by PiTiVi and other applications.
Buzztard Improvements,GStreamer,Tom Mast,"Buzztard is already an excellent tool for musical composition and a great example of the power of GStreamer, but there are some weaknesses that need improving. To begin with, Buzztard presently uses GstInterpolationControlSource which leads to troubles when pattern data changes because the respective queue needs to be changed. Second, the way songs are currently rendered to files is hard-coded in. This leaves no option for the user to change any of the encoding parameters to fit their needs. It is also quite a lot of work to add new formats to the available list at the moment. Third, it would be nice to have the option to record wave-table entries from various sources (a specified audio source or song playback). Fourth, to make it simpler to port the plugins to 0.11, an audio-synthesizer baseclass should be written. This would be used in the current synthesizers, as well as make it possible for new synthesizers to be written in the future. Finally, Buzztard needs to be ported to the 0.11 branch. Correcting these issues is the primary focus of this proposal."
ChapterSupport: Implement chapter support in more plugins,GStreamer,Anton Belka,"I want to implement GStreamer chapter (TOC) API in more media formats, such as RIFF-WAVE, FLAC(+CUE), QuickTime File Format. Now GStreamer has already implemented API to chapter support in Matroska format. Also I want to implement chapter structure reporting in gst-discoverer. I think this project is very important for all GNOME community including GStreamer community."
Developing a gstreamer plugin for hand gesture recognition,GStreamer,Andol Li,"The proposal aims to develop a gstreamer plugin for robust hand gesture detection and recognition. The proposed plugin will be able to detect and recognise a range of specifically-defined hand gestures in video streams. The plugin will take specific gestures and video streams as input and return matched video streams clips, and, the recognition results may also be outputted as parameters. The interaction part (such like video playing control) will be realised via cooperation with other gstreamer plugins."
Gstreamer based Waveform reading and drawing library,GStreamer,Peteris Krisjanis (Pēteris Krišjānis),"Project's goal is to create set of elements to manage waveform reading and display in various Gstreamer based applications. Currently it is done individually on per application basis (with none of implemetations convicingly being more superior than others), and developers are looking for common set of software to address this. Also several new applications are expressed desire of waveform functionality if such set is produced. It would also consolidate current efforts and give one shared code base to optimise and extend."
Improve and migrate GES ,GStreamer,Matas,The GES still not migrated to gst 0.11(and upcoming 1.0). Frontend still uses goocanvas (not clutter) and pygtk with gtk2. Some code from pitivi still could be part of GES. Project options (presets) should be updated. Timeline managment should be improved to match decent video editors.
add cpuidle support to haiku,Haiku,yongcong,"In modern Operating Systems, power efficiency is one of the important areas. Many OSs make use of both Macro and Micro technology to improve its power efficiency. The former includes suspend to ram, suspend to disk etc. The later includes the so called tickless, cpufreq and cpuidle. Generally speaking, cpufreq is used to change the clock speed of the CPUs based on system load while cpuidle is used to put CPU into deeper idle states(for example, C2, C3 state on x86) when idle.Currently, haiku lacks of deeper CPU idle state support. For example, on x86 during idle haiku only calls hlt instruction[1] which put CPU into C1 state. This project will add cpuidle support to haiku, including platform and driver independent framework and platform dependent drivers. This project will benefit haiku in power efficiency and will extends laptop's battery life under haiku."
BFS Partition Resizer,Haiku,Andreas Henriksson,"The goal of this project is to create a command line utility for resizing BFS partitions (more specifically, moving the end of the partition forwards or backwards). I would also attempt to add the resize functional to DriveSetup if there is time left for that."

OpenJDK port,Haiku,Hamish Morrison,"Port OpenJDK 7, including graphics and sound, to Haiku"
x86_64 port,Haiku,Alex Smith,"My proposal is an initial port of Haiku to the x86_64 architecture. While this is not a goal for R1, it is something that I think will benefit Haiku in the long term, as 64-bit CPUs are pretty much standard in PCs these days. It is unlikely that I will be able to complete a full port during the GSoC coding period, however it should be possible to complete at least a port of the boot loader, kernel and some modules/drivers, as well as possibly a small subset of userland."
Enable GHC to use multiple instances of a package for compilation,haskell.org,Philipp Schuster,People are running into dependency hell when installing Haskell packages. I want to help move in the direction of solving it.

"resizable, scalable, concurrent hash-table","HelenOS group at Department of Distributed and Dependable Systems, Charles University in Prague",Adam Hraska,"The kernel uses hash tables for several crucial subsystems;most notable, in IPC and the global page hash table. Thecurrent hash table implementation does not scale with agrowing number of elements (because the table never resizes)nor does it exploit concurrency.I would like to implement a resizable, concurrent hash tablebased on state-of-the-art algorithms. The kernel's requirementsalign well with properties provided by relativistic hash tablesutilizing the read-copy-update (RCU) primitive.HelenOS would benefit from this work in the following ways:1) Improved (memory as well as cpu) scalability of corekernel functions.2) RCU may be used as the building block of very interestingfunctionality (e.g. nonintrusive kernel tracing).3) Possibility of transferring the RCU functionalityinto user space as one of the first OSes to provideRCU as a first-class citizen synchronization primitiveto userspace drivers and applications."
Structured binary data tools,"HelenOS group at Department of Distributed and Dependable Systems, Charles University in Prague",Sean Bartell,"Exploring structured binary data is frequently necessary in HelenOS. Hex editors and scripting languages require too much work and don't handle the data in a fully structured way.

Theorem Proving in Geogebra : implementation of the aera method in OpenGeoProver,International GeoGebra Institute,Damien Desfontaines,"GeoGebra, the well-known interactive geometry application, currently lacks a automatic theorem prover, which would be able to answer questions such as ""Are those two lines parallel ?"", ""Are those points collinear"", etc. The program can answer to those questions by floating-point calculus, but we want something more formal, which could give a 100% sure answer.To meet this need, developers are currently integrating OpenGeoProver, an automated geometry theorem prover, into GeoGebra. The method used to automatically prove theorems in OpenGeoProver is Wu's method. The overall principle is pretty simple : the algorithm associates a set of polynomial equations to the geometric construction, and solves those equations using algebraic methods.I propose to add another method to OpenGeoProver, which has the advantage of being entirely geometric and to produce short, human-readable proofs : the area method. This method has been introduced by Chou, Gao & Zhang in Machine Proofs in Geometry, in 1994, and this has already been implemented in others geometry proving systems like GeoProof."

Add an Infinite Canvas / Wraparound mode for Krita,KDE,Shrikrishna Holla,"Krita focuses on texturing, matte painting and comics drawing. For texturing, the Krita image model needs to be expanded in two ways: First, the canvas needs to be made infinite, so the user can paint textures of any size without stopping, and second, a mode for creating tileable textures where painting strokes that go off the canvas, wrap over on the opposite side avoiding texture seams along the edges. Panning in this mode would essentially work just as an offset for the whole canvas to wrap around, allowing artists to check tiled textures for seams."

Multimodal Accessibility: Using Computer Vision to improve Speech Recognition in Simon,KDE,Yash Shah,"A major obstacle for command and control speech recognition systems is to differentiate commands from background noise. Many systems solve this by using physical buttons or certain key phrases to activate/deactivate the speech recognition.This project explores the use of computer vision to determine when to activate / deactivate the sound recognition using visual cues. For a media centre or robot applications, it would make a lot more sense to only activate the recognition when the user is actively looking at the screen/robot and is speaking something. This is strikingly similar to the day-to-day communication between humans!Face recognition can also be employed to provide different speech models for different people. In this way the media centre could adapt to different people in one household.Furthermore, In the current version of simon, users have to activate/deactivate the simon manually or using voice commands. In addition to that we can perform the gestures to control the on/off states of Simon by itself."

Perspective Drawing in Krita,KDE,Shivaraman Aiyer,"Krita is a 2D painting tool, but artists often need to give the illusion of depth. Krita has two tools to help the user draw perspective correctly: the perspective grid and the perspective assistant. The latter is more advanced, but needs improvements to become a real star feature. It needs to be expanded by allowing real 3D objects to be important and put into perspective. This means rotation, setting the vanishing point, scaling, and then integration with the paint tools. At the same time, to get into the codebase, the student should implement other missing features in the perspective assistant."

Also, QML can support more graphical artifacts than the C++ one."
QMLify Plasma widgets,KDE,Luís Gabriel Lima,"The aim of this project is to port some of the plasmoids that are currently written in C++ to QML.A great advantage in porting it is reduce the code maintenance effort for the KDE community. The plasmoids written in QML will have considerably less code as QML allows the creation of fluid UIs in a powerful declarative way."
Replacement for KmPlot,KDE,Percy Camilo Triveño Aucahuasi,This project is about to introduce a new application to KDEEdu suite. My application born as a fork from KAlgebra and I've been working on it for almost 2 years. Actually it has many features for drawing math functions (those features doesn't exists in KAlgebra nor KmPlot)
Semantic desktop collection in Amarok,KDE,Phalgun Guduthur,"Nepomuk has been a great semantic framework in recent years with many applications like Dolphin using it for managing metadata associated with its files and resources. But Amarok, still doesn't make use of the existing framework which comes bundled with any KDE distro. So, the objective of the project is to develop a Nepomuk based collection backend for Amarok which is functionally equivalent to the existing embedded MySql backend. An earlier attempt to achieve this was made this in GSoC 2008, but it never went on to be implemented and bundled along with the Amarok package because of reliability and performance issues. This is another attempt to make use of the excellent Nepomuk framework in Amarok and make it more semantic."
Simon SPHINX support,KDE,Vladislav,Creating fully functional Simon using SPHINX including support for (SPHINX) base models.
Social Music - Tomahawk features in Amarok,KDE,Lucas Lira Gomes,"Tomahawk is a cross platform, open source social media player that allows users to share music seamlessly and listen to it anytime, anywhere. Specifically, one of the key features of Tomahawk is the ability to connect to other's music collections.Providing that Tomahawk has gracefully demonstrated how wonderful could be if people were socially connected by their music, it would be a great idea to follow their path.Unfortunately, Amarok doesn’t have this ability yet, but this could be solved by making the use of some Tomahawk code in order to support the creation of a new Amarok service. This service would make possible to share user’s music files with online friends, thereby allowing them to listen to one another’s tracks. All that with the necessary precautions to maintain compatibility with Tomahawk network protocol."
Social services integration with KDE Workspaces (Plasma Desktop & Active),KDE,Martin Klapetek,"KDE Workspaces still miss strong integration of popular social networks and services like Facebook, Twitter and others. This project aims at bringing the social experience right to the desktop (and tablets, too)."

Statistics synchronization for pluggable devices and Last.fm,KDE,Matěj Laitl,"Amarok can maintain useful per-track play statistics and meta-data such as: play count, first/last played date, rating and labels; these are tracked for each collection separately. This project will implement statistics synchronization between all collections that support them (local, iPod) in its first part. Second part is to implement synchronization of the statistics from scrobbling services such as Last.fm to Amarok. (other way around already partially works)"
SUPPORT FOR PIVOT TABLES IN CALLIGRA SHEETS,KDE,Jigar,"Pivot Tables will be a data summarization feature for data visualization application (Calligra Sheets). Users can summarize data (also from ods files) by simply using drag & drop functionality.User has the freedom to choose the interested fields to work with and organize/summarize data as he/she wishes. It gives the user the analytical power by allowing him/her to rotate/transform columns to rows and vice versa and hence called “PIVOT”."
Template System for KDevelop,KDE,Miha Čančula,"A template system for code creation in KDevelop. Such a system currently exists for starting a new project, but I would add similar functionality for individual files, most notably for classes. I would also add an interface for creating and editing these templates. Additionally, users will be able to download and/or share these templates via GHNS. "
Tile based rendering in Okular page view,KDE,Mailson D. Lira Menezes,"To display a document, Okular currently renders the entire page at once even when only a section of the page is required. This can lead to a lot of memory consumption specially at high zoom levels. My proposal is to develop a tile based rendering for Okular page view so only those tiles needed will be rendered and shown."
UPnP / DLNA plugin for digiKam,KDE,Smit Mehta,"UPnP is a standard which allows discovery of and access to media contents in a home network. It is supported by many modern TVs and media receivers. With large collections of digital photos presentation on a TV is a natural solution but is not easily possible at the moment. This project will implement an inbuilt plugin in digiKam, which will let the user export her images on her home network and visible on all DLNA compliant devices."
Video Metadata Support,KDE,Abhinav Badola,"All recent digital-still camera devices provide video capture. digiKam must be able to manage these files as it do with images. digiKam can already play-back video and register files to the database, but it lack important metadata used to catalogue and sort items (as date, camera name, and all record conditions). To improve video files support, video metadata management done in background needs to be improved. This requires extensive work to be done on Exiv2 shared library, the back-bone of digiKam for photo metadata handling."
Website design and implementation for GamingFreedom/Gluon,KDE,Claudio Desideri,"Gluon is a project that aims to deliver a complete framework for creating and playing videogames.In order to give the player a great gaming experience we need to give him also an awesome distribution and feedback service. What's really missing is a cutting-edge website that satisfies players' desires like sharing statistics and games, discuss games with friends and much more. This can also help development allowing developers to receive feedback quickly and respond to it."
Write a KDE game using QML/QtQuick,KDE,Viranch Mehta,"This project idea involves porting an existing game from KDE Games to QML/QtQuick, and realizing how libkdegames can be evolved to more support QML games in future. For this purpose, I propose to port KBreakout."
Multidisk Support for the Syslinux Project,Kernel.org - the Linux Kernel Organization,André Ericson,"Syslinux currently does not support a scheme where one can specify a disk/partition on the command line. We propose the implementation of this schema using some kind of syntax similar to the one we have developed for COM32 module chain.c32. So perhaps something like [hd0,3]/foo/bar/baz or [mbr:0x12345678,5]/foo/bar, or even file://hd0,3/foo/bar/baz to make it URL-like."
Shoal graphing,Kernel.org - the Linux Kernel Organization,Nikolay Baluk,My ultimate goal is to implement a new database engine for Graphite real-time graphing system that interfaces with Shoal database architecture (SQLAlchemy as ORM and MySQL as DBMS). Also as extension I can update the main web inferface.
Shoal Project - Packaging and Deployment,Kernel.org - the Linux Kernel Organization,fenekku,"Statistics gathering over web servers / mirrors is not as readily available for systems administrators as the numerous logging features of current servers would lead one to believe. Making high level sense of the large amount of data coming from these computers is still challenging. The Shoal project tries to solve this problem by aggregating information from the numerous logs and presenting the system administrators with an interface to query relevant information from their data e.g. How many downloads of distribution X were downloaded in Germany in the past week? As a very young project, the Shoal project still lacks deployment capabilities, thus making it hard to propagate its potential benefits to other system administrators. This is where my project comes in. It would be the packaging of the application in such a way as to be deployable on other computers. System administrators would simply have to download the Debian or RPM package and then respectively do dpkg -i pkg.deb or rpm -Uvh pkg.rpm to install it. Eventually the goal would be to have the packages hosted in a repository so that apt-get install Shoal be all that is needed. "
Writing plugins for Shoal to deal with log types generated by servers other than apache,Kernel.org - the Linux Kernel Organization,tanghanhong,"Although apache is the most popular web server currently in use, it would be considerate to provide support for other servers like nginx, lighthttpd, git, rsync, and ftp in the form of plugins. The functionality of plugins for Shoal is log parsing and counting. Once one plugin for one of the server types mentioned above is done, other plugins are not far from ready, because the plugins are technically similar."

Tecla as an input device for desktops.,Komodo OpenLab,Akhil Rao,"Tecla Shield allows users to generate switch events which are transmitted using bluetooth.This events can be translated into the receiving device’s events.The main idea of this project is to make a desktop client that will receive the switch events from the Tecla Shield via bluetooth or an android device acting as a mediator in between the Shield and the desktop.Currently switch users rely on expensive dedicated equipment to access the computers.This project will provide a low cost alternative for the same.The project will mainly contain a cross-platform desktop client mostly written in java with a UI for customizing desktop events and switching eventsused to trigger them.It will also contain changes to the existing android application or a new application altogether that will relay switch events to the desktop and additionally the events from android itself. Alternatively the android application would be able to send dictated text from voice actions to the desktop computer as a simpler way to create documents for the switch users."
The Tecla Shield Meets Gaming Consoles (PS3),Komodo OpenLab,Rickee Charbonneau,"The goal for my project is to successfully develop a method for the Tecla Shield to communicatewith game consoles (Play Station 3 in this particular project), so as to be able to properly navigate the UI of each console. It will involve the emulation of a controller that is connected to the console."

Fault injection tool,MINIX 3,Anton Kuijsten,"From the minix gsoc website:We would like you to implement a new compiler-based fault injection tool which can be used for reliability testing on MINIX 3 . This should improve the existing Software Implemented Fault Injection (SWIFI) tool included in the MINIX distribution, which is based on tracing and can only be used for a limited number of OS components. We would like the new tool to be implemented as an LLVM transformation pass, to inject faults in predetermined program locations at compile- or link-time. Candidates for this project should be familiar with static program instrumentation techniques. Experience with the LLVM compiler framework is recommended. A successful project can lead to a publication in an international conference, which can be very helpful if you want to apply to a graduate school later this year."
LwIP Support,MINIX 3,Ambarisha,"The project aims to complete LwIP integration into MINIX 3. Basic support has already been added but it isn't complete and hasn't been tested properly yet.

AppInventor Components to pull data feeds and display them,MIT Center for Mobile Learning @ The Media Lab,Jose Dominguez,"The fact that mobile apps can consume and produce data is quite important in my opinion. Currently, working with Strings the get data out of an API or RSS feed is a bit of a messy process. Adding a component to make consuming and producing JSON easier would be a very interesting project for this summer. I have seen that the TinyWebDB Service works in a similar fashion but it adds a bit of complexity. It seems to be somehow limited by the fact that the service has to provide the data in the right structures (a custom App-Inventor-compliant API is needed to proxy requests, which sounds great in itself as a project, but might be a bit difficult for beginners). It also sounds a bit convoluted to use the TinyWebDB client to grab the data in first place.Although this is an area in which I'm certainly interested, I'd be happy to work on other parts of the project if needed."
Creating data feed components into MIT App Inventor,MIT Center for Mobile Learning @ The Media Lab,Vance Turnewitsch,"My proposal is described in the form I filled out at:http://people.csail.mit.edu/hal/summer-of-code.htmlTo ensure that I am not disqualified from GSOC, I am filling out this form on Google's site as well. In case this information is not automatically included in the form, my name and email address are:Vance Turnewitschbetweenthehills@gmail.com"

Also I do plan to make a testing page where the code can be copied and pasted to get the results on the fly. Testing page may be divided into frames on columns, one for code one for the output. As a part of GSoC, this will require, research of the MDN base and will involve extensive HTML5 and CSS3 coding, which again includes the coding with/for HTML5 and CSS3. Research on HTML and CSS will not be done or profound websites rather w3c docs will be regerred on the same"
Get ISPDB Into Production,Mozilla,Sergio R Charpinel Junior,"The Thunderbird ISPDB is an online configuration storage service for email providers.

Graphical Timeline of Events ,Mozilla,Girish Sharma,"Graphical Timeline of Events would act as a central backbone to view all the activities going in a browser. Making use of its three components - Content Producers, Data Sink and Graph - it will listen to, collect, and display various browser activities in real time. It is of a great use to any developer as he can view the actual results of his scripts or styles in real time and also view the errors, warning or messages if any. The most important feature of Timeline would be its strong integration with the existing Developer tools and the ability to be set up on a different computer remotely."

l10n Tool for Standardization of Localization,Mozilla,Gautam Akiwate,"A need is felt for standardization of translation of words during localization. As of now, lack of an exhaustive list of such standardized usage leads to various problems for l10n contributors and more so for new contributors wanting to join the community. In a nutshell, the goal of the project is to create an exhaustive database for entries, terms, words and the corresponding suggested translation for the same. This should also extend to work with small phrases and sentences.	The idea is to use a MT system on the existing localization work. Essentially, write scripts that would modify the existing localization work into a format suitable for MT system learning. These scripts will extend those that of ""Transvision"" which produces tmx files nightly. Based on the output of this step, a list will be created that would contain the entries, terms, words and the corresponding suggested translation. Corrections to this will be made, if any, manually. This then will be organized into a database along with a small web portal that will help contributors to l10n find words and preferred translations real easy. Again the working will be done using the Transvision portal as a base. At the outset the aim will be to do this for 4 languages (due to lingual restrictions in initial verification) but later extended to all languages supported by Mozilla. Finally, in addition to this quality comparison of suggestions from the tool compared to the already localized strings will be done and using the quality score from the MT system find if any inconsistencies exist in the localized strings. As can be seen, Transvision has partly achieved a few of the goals listed above. Hence, the plan is to leverage Transvision and extend it."

Professors on PopIt,mySociety,Dominik Moritz,"University professors play a very important role in our societies. They teach future generations, give statements in the media and are considered to be generally credible. But where do you find information about university professors like the professor's bio? Normally you would have to go to the website of the university or the professor's homepage. However, often some data is missing or very difficult to find.""Open does not only mean availability, but also accessibility!""As my SoC 2012 project I plan to extend PopIt so that one can add not only politicians or judges but also professors. This will help validating the platform itself and help people to better understand what professors say in the media."

A program to compute probabilities of ranked gene tree topologies in species trees,National Evolutionary Synthesis Center,Islam Ismailov,"A polynomial-time algorithm has been described for computing probabilities of ranked gene tree topologies given species trees. Once, implemented, ranked gene tree probabilities could be used to infer species trees, although inferring species trees is beyond the scope of the project. The idea is to consider ranked gene tree topologies, where we distinguish the relative order of times of nodes on gene trees, but not the real-valued branch lengths. "
Google Maps like Matrix browsing,National Evolutionary Synthesis Center,Pulkit Goyal,"Matrices are basic data stores used throughout evolutionary studies. Large (1000 by 1000), collaboratively built matrices of quantitative/qualitative are becoming increasingly common on the web, and a generic mechanism to browse (interact) with these data in the browser via a ""windowing"" mechanism would be broadly useful. The project focuses on building an interface which allow users to browse large data stored in the matrices. With this, user would be able to see and analyse large data stored on the web. It requires to build a jQuery library that will produce a Google-maps-like tile based interface. Users can drag to area of their interest and can see the data more clearly. To improve the performance neighbouring shell should be loaded in the background. Although the original idea is to have the plugin load and visualize large matrices, a well built tool for this task could further be used to display more complex objects (e.g. heat maps, highly detailed images etc.) as these objects can also be treated in form of a matrix. Hence the aim here would be to allow an open format for the cell values (e.g. HTML div) that can be extended to allow any kind of data in the future."

NeXML to MIAPA Mapping & ISAtab Transformation Project Plan,National Evolutionary Synthesis Center,Elliott Hauser,"MIAPA is a proposed minimum information standard for phylogenetic data sharing and reuse.Barriers to its adoption include lack of detail and definition in the standard itself (a draft standard has only recently been produced) and lack of tools supporting it.My project will focus on the latter.This project will identify data elements within NeXML that are MIAPA compliant and seek to extract them via XSL and then transform them into the ISAtab format via Java and XSLT.This will facilitate MIAPA use within ISAtools, a software system for collection, sharing, and repository submission with built-in support for minimum information standards.I also propose extensions for the project if I am ahead of schedule."
Optimizing R code for approximate bayesian computing,National Evolutionary Synthesis Center,DanielGates,"Approximate bayesian computing is becoming a more powerful approach for phylogenetic comparative methods. Unfortunately there are no real user friendly open source packages to run this oft-times computationally intensive process.

A Direct Interface Between R and Cytoscape,National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),,I would like to develop a seamless bridge between the language R and Cytoscape. This will allow users of R and Cytoscape to simultaneously work in both programs and utilize their unique strengths: R for analysis and Cytoscape for visualization. The goal is to keep a graph in R in sync with the equivalent graph in Cytoscape and any modifications to the graph itself would be consistent between both programs. This same idea could be further extended to other useful languages such as Matlab.

"Extend PathVisio with a plugin to create , modify and visualize data on biological pathways from scripting languages",National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Anwesha,"The plugin would allow users to call functions of PathVisio from within their scripting language of choice(such as C, Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby, R etc.) to create new pathways, modify existing pathways and visualize their data on the pathways.All the function calls are done through XML-RPC therefore the programming language chosen for making the function calls is irrelevant as long as it has an XML-RPC client implementation. Most major programming languages (Java, C, Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby, R etc.) have such an implementation."
GeneMANIA plugin for MedSavant,National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Khushi Chachcha,"MedSavant and GeneMANIA are invaluable tools to biomedical researchers. MedSavant is a database where researchers can query patient’s genomic information. Once a mutated gene of interest has been identified, researches may use GeneMANIA to identify other genes of interest which they can then use as query back into the MedSavant database to identify any other mutations in these genes that may contribute to the patient’s condition. There is an evident connection then between MedSavant and GeneMANIA. This project thus aims to create an effective way for researchers to use both tools by creating a plug-in for the MedSavant database that accomplishes the following:·-use GeneMANIA's visualization tool to visualize the genes of interest given a particular gene from the MedSavant database. -recognize any other mutations from the database in the network of genes created· -recommend proteins and pathways given the mutations and network of genes of interest for further exploration of the relation between the mutation and affected proteins"
IDEA 30: Pathway Comparison in PathVisio,National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Praveen Kumar,"The Pathway-Comparison-plugin will load two pathways and compare them in PathVisio on the basis of Data Nodes and their interactions.The user selects two pathways and hits the ""Compare"" button.The differences (which are actually the common nodes/interactions) between the 2 pathways are then listed in a Difference Viewer panel. Besides the list of differences, the Difference viewer will also have the 2 pathways loaded up and displayed side by side. The user could then select a difference from the list and this will be highlighted in both pathways."
IDEA 36: Data summary of tables in Cytoscape,National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Neil Dhruva,"Cytoscape shows tables as a spreadsheet, however users may want to view tables in other ways. To address this, Cytoscape 3 introduces table view, which are alternative widgets for showing tables. This project is a table view for summarizing numerical columns in two ways:Histograms. The table view shows a histogram based on the columns the user selects. The histogram is updated whenever the user selects different columns. The histogram’s number of bins is chosen by the user or can be calculated based on the width of the widget. When needing to include the histogram in a publication or presentation, the user can export it to a vector graphics file like PDF or EPS.Plots. The table view shows a plot of numerical values in the table based on the rows and columns the user selects. The plot’s X axis is the rows, and the Y axis is the columns. The user can reorder the rows and columns as needed. The X and Y axes show the names of its corresponding rows and columns. As in the histogram, the user can export the plot to a vector graphics file."

Understanding Complex Pathways using User Data and Web Services in PathVisio,National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Jake Fried,"IDEA 8: Understanding Complex Pathways using User Data and Web Services in PathVisioThe goal is to produce a user-friendly mechanism to filter/highlight nodes in PathVisio, a tool to draw biological pathways. Users would be able to upload text data from a variety of external sources (e.g. protein-drug or protein-biological pathway data; PharmGKB or DrugBank) or experimental data and then filter out nodes in a biological pathway based on a combination of this information. In addition to user-uploaded data, the tool might also pull data directly from pre-selected databases using web services; BioCatalogue provides directory of biology-oriented web services.An example query is that a user might like to know what proteins in a particular biological pathway are involved in cell division, are known targets to the cancer drug doxorubicin, and are also over-expressed in some experiment the user has performed.One example of a tool that already does this well for textual data is Google Refine (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LovigIDl634). This tool would help biologists navigate large, complicated pathways.Language and Skills: JavaPotential Mentors: Augustin LunaContact: wikipathways-discuss@googlegroups.com"

Moving CCV Forward - A Solid Foundation,Natural User Interface Group,Scott Halstvedt,"This project's goal is to finish designing and implementing the second version of NUI's Community Core Vision project, CCV2. The major architectural changes that set CCV2 apart from its predecessor are a modular, multithreaded architecture and a focus on extensibility and configurability. This will yield performance improvements for current applications, and also greatly increase the utility and ease of use of CCV. The application will also be separated into parts, a GUI/configuration client and a services daemon, that communicate through a well-defined API. This split configuration opens the door to implementations that vary for different client enviroments (different GUI's), and also enables the daemon to be run on a different machine from the client. Perhaps most importantly, CCV2 will lay a more robust foundation for continued research in Natural User Interfaces."
Open Source Infrared Frame,Natural User Interface Group,Alexandr Pirogov,"This document details the proposal of a project to the NUI Group (Natural User Interface) for the Google Summer of Code, 2012 edition.

Cost of existing infrared frames with true multitouch support is quite overvalued in comparison to summary cost of the components. With open source frame, this situation can be changed, due to growth ofcompetition between independent manufacturers. And, ideally, will bring significant decrease of cost for this frames, and, as a result, cost of devices, that use this technology."
Improving NTP's logging/debugging system,Network Time,Rajul,"Logs are emitted by network devices, operating systems, applications and all manner of intelligent or programmable device. A stream of messages in time-sequence often comprises a log. Logs may be directed to files, stored on disk, or directed as a network stream to a log collector.Logs are often created by the software developers to aid in the debugging of the operation of the application. Hence, log analysis must interpret messages within the context of an application, system or configuration in order to make useful comparisons to messages from different log sources.The goals of the project are to:•	Redesign/Change NTP's logging/debugging system. •	Write a common debugging/logging interface for NTP. 		Benefits to CommunityThe redesigning of the NTP's logging/debugging system is aimed at giving better control for logging and debugging and shall also be instrumental in improvement of ntpd's logging and diagnostic capabilities.A consistent logging interface for NTP and its projects would simplify its codebase and would make it more consistent.

Diff My DNA: Development of a Genomic Variant Toolkit for Biopython,Open Bioinformatics Foundation,Lenna Peterson,Genomic variants are small alterations in DNA sequences which often have important biological significance. A Biopython toolkit facilitating the use of genomic variant files will broaden the availability of these datasets to the biology and bioinformatics communities.
Multiple Alignment Format parser for BioRuby,Open Bioinformatics Foundation,Clayton Wheeler,"The MAF (Multiple Alignment Format) file format has become popular inbioinformatics for representing similarities, in the form of sequencealignments, between multiple whole genomes. Such multiple sequencealignments enable many kinds of analysis, including examination of thephylogenetic relationships between organisms, of conserved regions ofDNA potentially indicating functionally important sequences, andmaking inferences about genomes by reference to more fully annotatedgenomes (Blankenberg et al., 2011). Although BioRuby supports multiplesequence alignments through the bio-alignment gem, it does notcurrently support the MAF format. This project aims to rectify that bycreating a bio-alignment plugin to provide full MAF support from anative BioRuby interface. This is particularly important as MAF filescan often be in the hundreds of gigabytes and are often queried andfiltered in a rich way; programmatic access to them is valuable forthe same reasons programmatic access to databases isindispensable. Having native BioRuby support for MAF will thus allowuse of the sizable BioRuby toolset with this data, and also makeBioRuby a more viable tool for an important class of problems."
Robust and fast parallel BAM parser in D for binding against dynamic languages,Open Bioinformatics Foundation,Artem Tarasov,SAM/BAM data formats have become ubiquitous in bio-medical research due to wide use of next generation sequencing. The existing tools either don't use parallelism or are hard to bind against commonly used dynamic languages. This project aims to fill this gap.
SearchIO Implementation in Biopython,Open Bioinformatics Foundation,Wibowo Arindrarto,"Biopython is a widely-used Python-based toolset for working with biological data. It was built mainly to simplify biological data analysis workflows, for example by providing parsers for various data file formats, wrappers for command line programs, and interfaces for remote data sources. However, until now it still lacks a common framework for interacting with outputs of sequence search programs. These programs allow similarity-based searching across various biological sequence databases, a task inseparable from modern biology research. Unfortunately, extracting information from their outputs is often difficult due to the amount of results produced and the dense information packed with them. To solve this problem, this project aims to add a submodule called SearchIO to Biopython. SearchIO will allow more systematic information extraction from sequence-search programs’ outputs and an easier interaction with various output formats through a common programming interface. "

This project will also lay the groundwork for the new BioLib/HPC library."
Web Based RDM Tests & Integration with the RDM Index,Open Lighting Project,Ravindra Nath Kakarla,"Testing of RDM responders is a crucial task to check whether they conform to E1.20 specification. Currently the Open Lighting Project provides a python script 'ola_rdm_test.py' which performs tests on various RDM responders patched to the given universe. This script internally depends on 'ResponderTest' class which forms the part of the testing framework. The beauty lies in the fact that this class can be extended to write tests for new RDM devices which are not covered by the framework. As it involves a routine task of writing, running and seeing the test results, this can be automated and a web UI can be built to simplify the process. The second part of the project expands the 'model_collector.py' script to automatically update the responder details to the RDM product index. "

Floodlight Firewall Application,OpenFlowHub,Amer Tahir,"The OpenFlow protocol naturally supports a basic set of stateless firewall functions (L2-L4). Floodlight is an enterprise-class, Apache-licensed, Java-based OpenFlow Controller that allows building network-oriented applications on top of OpenFlow platform. Using the Floodlight’s modular architecture and APIs, this project aims to build a Stateless Firewall application that would impose ACL rules on switches in the network, implemented in form of a Floodlight Module that enforces ACLs by defining flows and monitoring packet-in behavior. The firewall module exposes a REST and a Web based interface for (1) Defining firewall rules, (2) Viewing and modifying existing rules, and (3) Retrieve firewall statistics (packets/bytes allowed and dropped) for each switch managed by the controller."
Integration of Flowvisor functions into Floodlight ,OpenFlowHub,Ayaka Koshibe,A major appeal of Software Defined Networking (SDN) is its facilitation of network virtualization. Flowvisor is a specialized OpenFlow controller that serves as a network virtualization layer by acting as a proxy between OpenFlow switches and multiple OpenFlow controllers. Adding Flowvisor's virtualization functions into Floodlight will enhance its capabilities as a controller geared towards both SDN deployment and development.

SimpleUI - Simple Toolkit Abstraction,OpenICC,nitin chadha,"Many a times, projects are written which require various plug-ins and user inputs for some configuration parameters. Those plug-ins present their own user interface, not necessarily in same language or platform, resulting in inconsistency for porting the projects on other platforms. Most of the times, it defeats the purpose of writing and making that projects. Hence, we require some system such that UI's do not pose obstacle in building such projects. Eg, suppose you have a project which requires use of some plug-in which only has a qt front-end. Hence, all other users , like that of gnome, windows, mac, etc will be forced to use command line, or worse, settle themselves with default values, simply because UI of some plug-in or module does not work on their platform. It lets the users of the project down, and hence a lack of confidence in that project. Also, projects somewhere resist themselves in using such plugins. Similarly, oyranos colour management system is in parts only a thin layer between imaging applications and advanced modules or plug-ins. To deploy these plug-ins flexible and maintain toolkit independency, plug-ins must present some consistent UI.SimpleUI tries to solve this problem. It creates a set of functions and widgets in standard formats which can be used for user input as such, as well allow programs to display their UI's for a specific UI library like gtk or qt. Goal is to create a simple and highly flexible GUI system, which allows easy creation of dialogs including callback mechanisms, advance UI configuration as well as platform independency."
Add image processing algorithms to OpenImageIO,OpenImageIO,Stefan,"I propose many image processing algorithms to be added to OpenImageIO. I have already implemented, tested and documented the algorithms, but many modifications are needed before they are accepted.

A Design and Implementation of Web Intent Agent on Android,OpenIntents,Cheng Zheng,"Web Intents is an upcoming framework for web-based inter-application communication and service discovery. This project explores possible ways of integrating Web Intents with Android intent system. To my knowledge, there are only two ways of using Web Intents: 1.Some versions of Google Chrome and Chromium 18 have native support to Web Intents. 2.By using the JavaScript shim provided by http://webintents.org/Firefox also has some experimental experiences in this field as described in web-activities-app-discovery. But I found that it seems very difficult to work on these in Andriod by myself. The reasons are: a. currently only ICS i.e. Android 4.x has brought in support to Chrome while all other versions seems not working if I continue my work on Chrome; b. Chrome extension for Web Intents is developed in C which is out of my reach. So after some considerations I decided to develop a new Android app named WIAgent which is a very simple browser now designed specific to Web Intents. Thus I can do my exploratory work on this app and have more control over it. In addition, this app is not restricted by ICS."

Desktop web client for OI apps,OpenIntents,Stanley,"The OpenIntents project offers many very useful applications for everyday businesses. To provide a much better user experience, it would be nice if one could access the data from a Laptop or Personal Computer at home or at work. Then you don’t have to use the small phone, but will benefit from a big screen and input devices.The easiest way to achieve this would be by using a web browser to connect to an android phone. This way you need no additional software except a server running on the device and it is a platform independent solution.Exactly this server is the app I want to design and implement during this year’s GSoC and which I’m going to describe in detail within this proposal."
Desktop Web Client For OpenIntent Applications,OpenIntents,Bhaskar Kandiyal,"The idea is to develop a web client for OpenIntent applications to manage their data from a desktop web browser over a WLAN network.A server application will be developed that will be installed on the Android device and will act as an interface between the installed OI apps data and the web browser."
"OI File Manager redesign, code cleanup and performance enhancement.",OpenIntents,George Venios,"OI File Manager has been online since the early days of Android. This is both an advantage and a responsibility as on the one hand it has a really big user base, but on the other hand it has been running long enough for the code to become messy and the UI obsolete. Now that the Ice Cream Sandwich Style Guide has been released, it is of great importance to follow it as early as possible and provide a product that will be consistent with the rest of the platform, so that a great user experience will be ensured. Furthermore, most of the other file managers on the market don’t follow these guidelines, and promoting one of the most successful OI applications through the timely use of the latest and greatest features of the platform can only be good for the OI whole brand.

In-page Localization,OpenMRS,Mykola Vorobey,"In-page l10n tool will allow making translations of OpenMRS right when viewing web page. For now, it’s annoying for developers to make number of steps to provide even a default translation of a text message within OpenMRS. In addition, actual translators also need to complete a lot of actions to provide further translation. Obviously, it makes translations process inconvenient and not efficient. So, the main goal of this project is to implement and integrate pretty handy tool for in-page l10n."
Logging Errors to the Database,OpenMRS,Dmitry Krivenko,"The more application the more potential errors in it can be. That's why any big project has many tests. The role of testing is to determine the presence and location of errors remaining in a well-designed program. But tests still can not anticipate all possible errors and bugs in the application. So developers began to use logging. Log messages that tell what the application is doing can help locate any defects that are present is application. Without logging in an application, maintenance can become an intricate problem for the developers.But even with a system of logging in the application programmer is still hard to keep track of all the errors, because the application can use several different organizations. And end-users have to somehow report to the administrator of application about error, and he in turn to developers. The administrator must to find detail information about error in the server logs andsend this information to the developers. This is a laborious and lengthy work. So the developers of OpenMRS solved this problem by using default error handler. They provide information about error to users in the default error handler so that they can provide a specific error log id along with their bug report. So end-users can report bugs directly to the developers. Currently user can press button ""Report Problem"" to report about error and afret then create a new ticket on bugtracker. But it is still far from ideal mechanism for fixing bugs.So, the main goal of my project is to create tools to improve and systematize the error detection mechanism."
Merge Concept Module ,OpenMRS,Jordan Kellerstrass,"Merge concept tool for altering concepts through the entire database: As the OCC and MCL are improving to manage concepts from various sources, it is time for a super admininstrative tool for changing concept_ids through-out the database. The application would search obs, drug, program/ workflow/ state, all varieties of forms, etc. for tables which use the concept_id (including answer_concept/discontinued_reason/ etc) and replace with a different concept. This would be helpful when cleaning duplicate concepts and merging with other concept dictionaries."
Metadata Sharing Server Project,OpenMRS,SriHarsha,The goal of this project is to create a central repository of metadata where OpenMRS installations can publish their metadata.

Computer vision add-on for Orange,Orange – Data Mining Fruitful & Fun,Andrej T.,Development of a add-on (set of widgets for Orange Canvas) that will introduce computer vision functionality to Orange. The core of the add-on will be the Python computer vision library OpenCV. The development of this add-on and the gathered findings will be then used for improving the Orange core.
Multi-Target Learning for Orange,Orange – Data Mining Fruitful & Fun,Miran Levar,"Orange already has a multi-target tree learner, but it is written in python and is therefore slow, especially when used in a random forest. Implementing the multi-target tree learner in C++ would quicken classification considerably and also lower its spatial complexity. The tree learner would be based on the Top-down induction of clustering trees proposed by Blockeel and De Raedt and would extend Orange's SimpleTreeLearner.Because tree learning algorithms really come to life inside random forests, integration with Orange's random forest would be another focal point. Orange is progressing towards version 3.0, therefore the implemented code would be integrated with the new version. Once the algorithms are implemented and integrated, an experimental study would be performed comparing the implemented multi-target tree classifier with established multi-target classifiers (e.g. PLS, Bayesian classifiers) on benchmark datasets.Finally, tests, documentation and scripting reference would be written."
Widgets for statistics,Orange – Data Mining Fruitful & Fun,Amela Rakanović,The goal of this project is implementing a set of standard statistical methods in Orange in its own spirit and style.

Porting discontinued Axios Spatial Tools into uDig core 1.3,OSGeo - Open Source Geospatial Foundation,Marco,"Geographical Information System desktop tool are essential to any spatial scientist. They are their swiss-army knife. Since this market is a niche one, it is ruled by few major companies selling full-featured products. Despite this the open source community could find a way into it and uDig is one of the most effective products of this effort.Along the complex history of this software, many actors were involved and gave their contribution to its success. Unfortunately not all stories had a happy end. It is the case of the really interesting set of spatial tools developed by Axios.Since the closure of the Spanish Axios (former website http://www.axios.es) the uDig# project has moved to version 1.3.0.This caused the Axios uDig Extensions to be discontinued and not to be available in current uDig framework.This is a real issue and a pity since the Axios’ were the most complete and and stable set of tools to perform interactive topological editing and visually-aided spatial operations within uDig.The essence of this proposal is hence to apply for admission in Google Summer of Code with the specific goal of porting “Axios uDig Extensions” into the current uDig 1.3.x framework."

Android-based application for devices autoconfiguration,PacketFence,Mesut Can Gürle,"""Android-based application for devices autoconfiguration"" idea is about providing automatically network connection. Networks which use 802.1x are generally hard for an end user to connect. Because the protocol itself supports a lot of encryption algorithms. For an end user it can be hard to configure it. For IOS based devices an aoutonomus system has already developed. Some settings and user credentials are put into an xml file called .mobiconfig. Using this file gives end user to connect a network, vpn connection, E-mail server settings, exchange settings, Ldap settings etc (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/iPhoneConfigurationProfileRef/Introduction/Introduction.html). Using a .mobiconfig file for wifi connection provides a secure and simple configuration for users. PacketFence has already this feature.

Ultimately, we would create a platform that allows developers to create interactive applications using the Microsoft Kinect, Tegra 3, and PCL all out of the box with minimum efforts. Together, we hope this would encourage developers to explore applications that utilize these hardware and provide richer and unique user experiences. Additionally, computational intense tasks such as feature extraction/recognition can be offloaded to a remote server. Then, the computed results are transferred back to the mobile devices in real-time. By decoupling the computation from the devices, we could support a large variety of platforms despite the hardware limitation on some of the mobile devices."

Better indexing for ranges,PostgreSQL Project,Alexander Korotkov,"Range types are singnificant new feature of PostgreSQL. Indexing of range types is necesary to provide efficient search of ranges. The currently implemented for 9.2 indexing approach for GiST holds ranges in both internal and leaf pages entries. This approach could be very inefficient in the case of highly overlapping ranges and ""@>"", ""<@"" operators, because cost of search is similar to cost of search using ""&&"" operator. Mapping ranges into 2d-space could handle such cases much more efficiently. This project is focused on implementation 2d-space mapping based GiST and SP-GiST operator classes for range types."

Streamlining Bluetooth Connectivity in Processing for Android,Processing,Joshua Albers,"Bluetooth connectivity is ubiquitous amongst Android devices, but there are no libraries that handle actual device-to-device communication Android. As a result, klunky calls to the Android SDK libraries are required to use basic Bluetooth communications in a Processing app running on Android. I propose developing a library that, at the very least, streamlines basic serial communication over Bluetooth so it is as easy on Android as it is in a desktop Processing application or on an Arduino device. Time permitting, the library will also be made more robust by implementing methods to use Service Delivery Protocol (SDP) and increase the ease of use for other protocols."
Configurable latency for Bluetooth devices,PulseAudio,poljar,"Pulseaudio currently uses the same hard-coded latency value for all Bluetooth devices.

Admin interface for SQL database may not need customization, but in a end-user application developer may need to change any of attributes reflected from sqlalchemy model. Colander design makes it easy to provide such functionality. Needless to say, I will do test-driven development, deliver 100% test coverage and documentation."

Cython Pxd generation using gcc-python-plugin,Python Software Foundation,Philip Herron,Cython uses pxd files like headers for declarations of types and functions so cython can generate the necessary c-wrapper code such that we can call into other libraries. Creating pxd files for large libraries is very time consuming and is all manual work. Having a tool to parse over the necessary headers to find declarations aromatically would be a great help to the community.

Empirical Likelihood in Statsmodels,Python Software Foundation,Justin Grana,"In 1990, Art Owen published “Empirical Likelihood Ratio Confidence Regions” in The Annals of Statistics, which ignited a fury of research exploring the techniques and possibilities of empirical likelihood estimation.In 2009, statsmodels was released as its own package for statistical computing in the Python language and has subsequently grown to include among others,linear, nonlinear and time series regression models.In a way, empirical likelihood estimation and statsmodels are similar; they are both relatively new in their respective fields but are packed with unexploited opportunities that can benefit researchers, financial analysts and policymakers alike.That is why I propose implementing empirical likelihood estimation in statsmodels for my Google Summer of Code 2012 project."
Fast Numerical Computing with Cython,Python Software Foundation,Mark Florisson,"This project proposes to support fast array expressions for Cython, through efficient elementwise traversal which maximizes cache re-usal and appeals to auto-vectorization on the CPU, as well as provide optional OpenCL code specializations for GPU execution. Partial reductions and elementwise user functions will be supported in array expressions, and boolean index assignment (and possibly evaluation) will be implemented. Optionally, we propose enhancements to the current parallel support to allow OpenCL as a backend.This project will also investigate code re-use with similar project like Theano, NumExpr and Numba."

Need for scikit-learn speed,Python Software Foundation,Vlad Niculae,"The scikit-learn library has become very successful due to its complementary goals of being comprehensive and efficient. Many core pieces of code are highly efficient and compete with famous implementations. This project aims to bring a uniform standard of speed through quality iterations over the code of the less optimized corners of the codebase. We will also add a continuous benchmark in the spirit of speed.pypy.org that will make it easy to ensure that what's fast stays fast, and what's slow is easy to find."
Optimizing sparse linear models using coordinate descent and strong rules.,Python Software Foundation,I. Bayer,"Scikit-learn is a Python machine learning library that aims to be easy to use through a well designed interface. Dependencies are kept to a minimum and the extensive use of NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib give great computing power and ease the understanding of the codebase.Data sets with far more features than samples are rapidly gaining on popularity and bring the class of linear models back to focus. This project will bring additional state of the art optimization routines for sparse linear models to scikit-learn and even further reduce dependencies. All code accepted to scikits.learn must include a high test coverage, documentation, examples and intensive benchmarking.Linear models are used for regression as well as for classification tasks. In both cases penalty terms can be used to obtain an implicit feature selection. To efficiently solve these penalized linear models is the main focus of this project.The here proposed improvements will be beneficial for a wide range of general problems and specialized domains such as gene expression analysis, compressed sensing, and sparse encoding."

Twisted : Expanded Endpoints Support,Python Software Foundation,Ashwini Oruganti,"Recently, two new APIs,IStreamServerEndpoint and IStreamClientEndpoint were added to Twisted, for specifying what address the servers should listen for connections and what address a client should connect to, respectively. But not all of the addresses that Twisted supports have this endpoint support added to them; presently endpoint support has been implemented for TCP, SSL and UNIX domain sockets. My project deals with adding more endpoint implementation to Twisted, some involving wrappers around the existing APIs (e.g. serial ports, standard I/O), others involving making fresh APIs where setting up connections was difficult before the addition of the endpoints (e.g. SOCKS and HTTPS proxies)."

It applies current research on return-based analysis of strategy or fund returns for risk, autocorrelation and illiquidity, persistence, style analysis and drift, clustering, quantile regression, and other topics.PerformanceAnalytics has long enjoyed contributions from users who would like to see specific functionality included. In particular, Diethelm Wuertz of ETHZ (and the well-known R/Metrics packages) has very generously contributed a very large set of functions based on Bacon (2008). It is a great starting point, but many of these functions need to be finished and converted such that the functions and interfaces are consistent with other PerformanceAnalytics functions, and are appropriately documented. In addition the functionality proposed in Bacon is incomplete in the contributed functions.That will require writing or re-writing the function with reference to Bacon (2008) and other underlying referencesLastly all the functions must be well documentet thanks to the roxygen2package"

In our project, we will extend the knitr package for better applications in the web so that web pages can be easily compiled with R like Sweave documents. The knitr package is a general-purpose tool for dynamic report generation; the basic idea is like Sweave: we only write source code in a document mixed with normal texts, then use a tool to evaluate the code to get output, so that we do not need to copy and paste results from the computing engine to the output document. Knitr comes with a flexible design and can be extended to multiple output formats via output hooks.In this project, we will enhance HTML features of knitr package, including code highlighting, animation support, markdown conversion and integration with website-building tools."

Use hash or map in POSIX keys,RTEMS Project,Zhongwei Yao,"The objective of this project is reducing the memory overhead inthe implementation of POSIX keys without adding any extra lookup overhead by some proper hash or map algorithm. This feature is required by two reasons: first, the POSIX key area is not properly extended when the number of threads is increased(dynamically created) if POSIX threads are configured as ""unlimited"", which is a known bug. Second, extra memory is reserved in keys for each thread or task in current implementation, which can be heavy memory overhead when keys increase since key can be dynamically created."

Upgrade Translation Functionality,Sahana Software Foundation,Vivek Hamirwasia,"This project aims to update the existing translate facility in the software. When Sahana is deployed during a disaster or emergency, it would require immediate translation. Hence to avoid wastage of time and effort, we would want to translate only those strings which are present in the active modules. These strings are then presented to the translators who can make the necessary translations. Once this is done, it must be possible to integrate back these translations into the main code. Also, a GUI must be developed to indicate the translation status. So basically the idea is to automate the entire process of this selective translation. Briefly, following are the objectives I plan to achieve :-1) Retreive the relevant strings to be translated based on the current active modules by maintaining the location of each string (pathname and line number).2) Provide these strings in the form of a spreadsheet to the translators for them to translate the strings.3) Accept the translated set of strings and reflect back the changes in the code.4) Build a GUI to display the translation status per module.5) Allow comments to be added inside the T(...) function."

Porting and extending the Parallel Collections for the Android platform,Scala Team,Ivan Oreskovic,"Scala Parallel Collections [1] are a proven data-parallel programming API for writing parallel applications on the Java Runtime Environment. They automatically parallelize bulk operations such as filtering, mapping, grouping or traversal of elements. The entire framework is extensible with new collection implementations and, since the upcoming 2.10 release, modular in the scheduler implementation [2].Programs written in Scala are compiled to the JVM bytecode, and thus easily ported to the Android platform [3][4]. The Scala development on the Android is gaining more and more traction for this reason. With the arrival of multicore devices on the Android platform, parallel collections are becoming increasingly interesting to Android developers as they can bring significant speedups to existing applications.There are several goals in the proposed project:* First, to improve the build system for Scala development on Android.* Second, to port parts of the Fork-Join framework relevant for the existing parallel collection scheduler to the Android platform.* Third, to implement a version of the scheduler which is more suited for datasets for which the amount of work-per-element is skewed.* Fourth, to implement a set of additional primitives for the parallel collections framework which are relevant for Android apps.* Finally, evaluate the performance of parallel collections on the Android platform and produce a detailed report on this.These items are explained further below."
Real-time raytracer written functionally in Scala,Scala Team,Jerzy Redlarski,"The aim of the project is to create a graphics engine with a raytracing renderer. The project would be written mostly in Scala and adhering to the functional programming paradigms. One of the goals is to make the rendering in real-time, so that it can be used in games, 3D visualization tools and CAD applications.Functional programming is perfect for this kind of problems, since rendering as a whole is a functional problem (take a model and generate an image). Raytracing is also an embarrassingly parallel problem (scaling near linearly with the number of processors), which means that functional programming allows for easy multithreading. The mathematical nature of 3D computer graphics makes functional programming a natural choice for expressing many of the algorithms and data structures.The project will be written with the Kojo Learning Environment in mind ( http://www.kogics.net/kojo ), serving as a 3D renderer for this project founded by Lalit Pant."

I'm applying for a project that will implement a generic multiclass learning framework in shogun. While shogun is the state-of-the-art toolbox for binary classifiers, more multiclass methods need to be added to make it competitive in this area. Many real-world problems are naturally multiclass. So adding strong multiclass support for shogun would benefits a large community. "
Bundle method solver for structured output learning,Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox,Michal Uřičář,"Learning of the structured output classifiers leads to solving a convex minimization problem which is not tractable by standard algorithms. A significant effort in ML community has been put to development of specialized solvers among which the Bundle Method for Risk Minimization (BMRM), implemented e.g. in popular StructSVM, is the current the state-of-the-art. The BMRM is a simplified variant of bundle methods which are standard tools for non-smooth optimization. The simplicity of the BMRM is compensated by its reduced efficiency. Experiments show that a careful implementation of the classical bundle methods perform significantly faster (speedup ~ 5-10) than their variants (like BMRM) adopted by ML community. The goal will be an OS library implementing the classical bundle method for the SO learning and its integration to Shogun."

In this project Also we have to redesign search and detailed pages of module/widgets. "
Module System Refactoring,SilverStripe,Andrew Short,"Currently there's no way to define dependencies, organise modules into subfolders or easily submit them to a central repository. With the recent surge in popularity of the composer/packagist pair, I think it would be great to take advantage of this really useful system rather than inventing our own Update the module system to one based on composer/packagist. This would allow module authors to define all the metadata for a module inside a JSON file (tags, requirements etc etc), and all the versioning would be inferred from source control. This means submitting a module would be as easy as submitting the URL to your repository."

Finding all equilibria reachable by Lemke-Howson,The Gambit Project,Virag Varga,"For a two-player in strategic form (also called bimatrix games), what are the Nash equilibria that can be found using the Lemke-Howson method? Each pure strategy as an “initially dropped label” leads to an equilibrium along a computational path obtained by “pivoting” in a linear system. If two equilibria found in that way are different, using the second label on the first equilibrium (and vice versa) will find yet another equilibrium. The set of all equilibria reachable in that way should be recorded and is a (normally) fast way to find many equilibria when the game is large."

jpf-qif : Quantitative Information Flow Analysis for Java Bytecode,The Java Pathfinder Team,Quoc-Sang Phan,"Computer systems in the real world are never 100% secure, so we need to measure how secure they are. As a simple example, suppose an attacker tries to guess a password: if his guess is correct, he can obtain all the information; otherwise he can still learn that the password is not the same as the previous try, so his search space is narrowed. In either the cases, the password checking program does leak some information. The aim of this project is to use Java PathFinder to quantify leakage of confidential information in Java programs."

"
Semantic Porting Analysis based on JPF Regression DiSE and DSE,The Java Pathfinder Team,bray,"To introduce similar features or bug fixes developers often port code from one program context to another. Ad hoc porting can produce various side effects if the source and target contexts differ. As ported edits are similar to reference edits, a syntactic program differencing tool cannot identify such semantic discrepancies. In this project we propose to develop a semantic porting analysis tool using the JPF framework. Given a pair of source and target edits as input our tool will generate test cases to manifest differences in the input-output behavior of the source and target contexts."

Adding a data prefetching transformation to LLVM Polly – generating load-balanced and coarse-grain loop pipelinable code for more task level parallelism and data locality,The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure ,Junqi Deng,"I propose adding a prefetching transformation to LLVM Polly. Such transformation splits the innermost loop into three task level pipelinable parts. They are head, which prefetches data, body, which performs calculation, and foot, which stores back data, and their loads (execution time) are balanced. The transformed code in some sense mimics the behavior of cache, but it is much more than cache because it is timely, accurate and simple. This transformation can well benefit those architectures with on-chip scratch-pad memory and capable of task level parallelism, such as GPU and FPGA. It will also work on multi-core CPU with non-blocking data cache prefetch instruction. Therefore, it will enable LLVM Polly to perform a much larger range of locality optimization."
Common memory safety instrumentation and optimization passes for LLVM,The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure ,Ott Tinn,"The goal of this project is to modify SAFECode and AddressSanitizer (ASan) to use a common set of memory safety instrumentation and optimization passes to increase code reuse. These tools and other similar ones use varying runtime methods, but are fundamentally trying to do the same thing: check whether each memory access is safe. It is desirable to optimize away redundant runtime checks to improve such tools' runtime performance. This means that there is a need for shared memory safety instrumentation and optimization passes."

Network Administrator to the cloud land,Umit Project,Amit Pal,"Network Administrator to the Cloud Land is a monitoring tool which runs on the cloud and allows users to manage their hosts and networks. Monitoring tools such as the Network Inventory send events to NA using the Rest API. An Event is a single information about what happened on a server. These events contain a message, type of event, name of network protocol, and other host information. What makes this NA different from other Network Administrators is its functionalities such as having a sharable host, storage of data on the cloud, widgets and plugins which will allow the users to develop new features according to their requirements etc. Moreover, users do not have to know about the Django architecture and NA core in order to develop plugins.The base required to run the Network Administrator has already been developed during the last Summer of Code. This summer of code mainly aims at extending the current functionalities such as an improvement of the current permission system, improved widgets and plugin API; and adding new features such asIpV6 support, Ajax support for each widget, Feeds for Skype and IRC, a comment section for each event, addition of more layers on the map, various plugins which allow users to take any action on hosts, and various visualizations in the form of graphs and charts which will help users to easily interpret data.

OpenMonitor - The Aggregator,Umit Project,Orçun Avşar,"Open Monitor is an Internet connectivity monitor. Aggregator is the central server that gathers information from peers those are spread around the globe.Aggregator currently works on Google AppEngine. This platform offers scalability that helps handling big data. However, availability is one of the another major goals for distributed systems and peers shouldn't be affected from routing blockages and service failures (e.g. write disables) to/on AppEngine. This project aims to improve current aggregator system. First, writing a specialized slave server application that works on different platforms. This server should act as a buffer during GAE service outages and as a gateway during blockages.Second part needs analysis of agent reports and drawing a heat map to show Internet connectivity for different regions and countries.Also, IPv6 support is needed to handle IPv6 addresses."
OpenMonitor : Inter-Peer Routing Mechanism,Umit Project,Narendran Thangarajan,"One core functionality required in the OpenMonitor project is dynamic scalability. Currently, the list of super-peers is stored statically in a local database. This works fine for a fixed and limited set of peers (which is never the real-time scenario where new peers emerge every second). Thus my proposal is to implement a dynamic super-peer selection and inter-peer routing algorithm for messages, based on Kademlia P2P routing mechanism. Maidsafe-DHT is the reference implementation considered. The implementation is for both the Mobile and the Desktop ICM Agent."

Green SMW,Wikimedia Foundation,Nischay Nahata,"This project is about increasing the performance of Semantic MediaWiki -an Extension to MediaWiki which turns a wiki's information into a powerful database which can be processed and queried extensively.But when used with wikis with a lot of data it has a few performance degradation issues such as:1. Frequent writes to the database (writes occur even if nothing has changed).2. Some Special pages require expensive database queries, loading those takes lot of time.3. RDF exports and RSS feeds (frequently generated by Users) require many string concatenations in PHP which are not efficient.4. Pages that display large inline query results or use complex templates can lead to hundreds of database queries leading to slow performance.5. SMW database was designed with an extendable storage abstraction layer in mind, but later the number of DataItems was fixed at 10, the database design thus needs a few refinements.My proposal is to improve the performance by making efficient use of the resources and implementing caching to reduce SMW's energy consumption."
Incubator improvements and language support,Wikimedia Foundation,Robin Pepermans,"This project is a follow-up to my ongoing work as a volunteer to improve the language support in MediaWiki and to improve the usability of the Wikimedia Incubator.I would like to include a default list of languages names in English, which is currently in Babel but can be useful in MediaWiki in general, and also for WikimediaIncubator specifically because the automatic info pages otherwise do not recognise language codes. I'd also improve the current automatic info page on Incubator and extend it to be used as a replacement for the test wiki template. This will include a special page that guides contributors in their first steps to start on Incubator and start a test wiki."
Integration of Flickr and Geolocation in Upload Wizard,Wikimedia Foundation,Ankur Anand,"My goal is to provide an interface which allows the user to transfer images from Flickr where the Upload Wizard extracts license and metadata from the images, converts the license into a Commons License Template and passes on metadata to the next step to generate corresponding WikiText. Second part of my proposal aims at implementing a JavaScript jQuery plugin which presents a map interface that can be manipulated to select a particular location and report that location in code, preferably as WikiText containing a Location template."
Realtime Collaboration on Visual Editor,Wikimedia Foundation,Ashish Dubey,"Realtime collaboration on Visual Editor would allow Visual Editor to be used much like Etherpad, Google Wave, and similar other collaborative editors.This project aims at implementing Phase 1 of the Realtime Collaboration project whose features would be - (1) Allow single editor in an editing session, others can spectate changes made in realtime.(2) The editing control can be passed over to another client by the current editor.(3) Provide codebase for extending with Phase 2 features; Multiple editors, and concurrency control."
TranslateSvg: Bringing the translation revolution to Wikimedia Commons,Wikimedia Foundation,Harry Burt,"TranslateSvg has the potential to revolutionise the ability of Wikimedia's diverse groups of image maintainers to work together on the same communal set of SVG images. At the moment, providing alternative translations of SVG files typically requires ""forking"" the image. This drastically increases the image's maintenance burden and discourages image improvement. TranslateSvg would completely change this suboptimal workflow by allowing translations to be embedded within a single image file."

Implement missing functions in D3DX9,Wine (a project of Software Freedom Conservancy) ,Józef Kucia,"There was a lot of work done regarding the implementation of D3DX9 in Wine, but some functionality is still missing. The aim of this project is to implement missing functions in D3DX9 with focus on functions which are used frequently."
Joystick configuration and testing applet,Wine (a project of Software Freedom Conservancy) ,Lucas Fialho Zawacki,"The idea behind the project is to create the tools, as well as a graphical user interface, to ease the configuration and testing of joysticks and other input devices under Wine. Some support for this configuration exists already in the form of registry key settings and the objective is to make this easy and intuitive with visualization of joystick axes and buttons, manual testing of force feedback devices, the ability to enable/disable specific connected devices and more. "
Wine – Implementing a DSS provider,Wine (a project of Software Freedom Conservancy) ,Marek K Chmiel,"Wine is an tool that allows users to run Windows software without actually having to use the Windows operating system. Though the security standard for years has been RSA enhanced, some application use DSS which has not yet been implemented in Wine. This is where I will be implementing the DSS (digital signature standard) provider within Wine. By implementing PROV_DSS, aprovider type, I will be able to solve bugs caused by the lack of this provider. "
[Ryzom Core] Ryzom GUI Editor,WorldForge,dfighter,"Ryzom has a very powerful and flexible GUI which can be configured from XML files. The XML GUI configuration files define the GUI layout, the widgets, and the data source for the widgets ( in reality it can only use the CDB system as a data source, but nevertheless the location of the data can be specified within the CDB and it's still a lot more flexible than having to fill the data with code ).This project involves extracting the GUI code from Ryzom and turning it into a reusable library, then building a GUI editor on top of it using the Qt framework. The editor shall be able to load existing GUI XML files and create new ones."
[Ryzom Game Functionality] Implement Character Achievements,WorldForge,SirCotare,"When achievements for Ryzom were introduced on the Ryzom Armory[1], the resonance from the community was very good. I'd like to give every player the chance to benefit from achievements without relying on third-party mechanisms. Therefore the current achievement system should be moved onto the Ryzom servers, allowing for a more detailed progress tracking and also access to the achievements via WebIG."
Automatic adjustment of graphical level and extra features for Graphics Settings menu.,WorldForge,Arjun Kumar,"The goal of this project is to implement a system that adjusts the graphics level of the Ember client automatically to get a smooth FPS.As an additional goal, I aim to implement new options in the Graphics Settings menu."
Automatic mesh LOD management system,WorldForge,Peter Szücs,"Ember uses high quality graphical models, but doesn’t provide low quality versions of them. When a model is far away from the camera it is not required to render high quality models, since the user sees it on screen for just few pixels. This makes Ember to require high-end graphics cards. The automatic LOD (Level of detail) management system is about to solve this problem. It will create from high quality models multiple low quality models, by reducing vertex count with an algorithm. This allows for far away rendering to use low quality models, which will increase graphical performance. Next to the automatic LOD management, I want to provide possibility to manually configuring the LOD for a given model, which will allow fine-tuning for performance critical models. I will also design and create a GUI for the manual LOD configurations in the model editor to make fine-tuning an easy task."
CEGUI Samples Framework,WorldForge,Lukas Meindl,"The CEGUI user interface library currently has a great number of demos which are all split into seperate executable files. Additionally a lot of them are very old and some do not represent CEGUI's features in a good fashion.Therefore I suggest to create a sample browser, a single executable that unifies all samples and makes it possible to add new demos easily. The sample browser would be written in C++ and would also support python and Lua demos. As the next step I would like to change all existing demos, improving their visual appearance and functionality, removing useless ones, merging redundant ones, and adding new ones that i deem useful and representable for the library.My goal is to provide a sample browser in the end, which contains a set of useful, appealing demos, that give newcomers a good impression of the library and help them understand how it works, what can be done with the library and how certain features can be used. For this I would also like to create a special environment in which the sample viewing takes place, like a 3D room with screens, each displaying one demo on it."
"Create an End-User Defined, Dynamic Rank Structure Within the Guild Manager",WorldForge,Malik Butler,"As stated above I will be creating an end-user defined, dynamic rank structure within the guild manager. The Guild manager already has a Grade system (Member, Bearer, Recruiter, Officer, High Officer and Guild Leader) and each grade has their own permission. One thing it doesn't have is the ability for a Guild Leader to define his own hierarchybased on ranks he/she would like to use (e.g. Soldier, Sergeant, Lieutenant). I feel this addition will add depth to the multi-player community that cannot be experienced without it."
Develop Mason Game System,WorldForge,Anthony Pesce,"Implement a game play system where one can build and construct fortifications for the mason game system.The system would use a hierarchy to gather and construct this base, and the interface would be very apparent and intuitive."
Ryzom Core: Camera animations and sound triggers,WorldForge,Fabien Henon,"Implement sound triggers and camera animations during missions. We have to be able to play sounds at a given moment or event during a mission. The sounds can be attached to a NPC, a player in the game or they can just be at a specific location. Sounds can also be different in function of the language of the player.Beside the sounds, I will implement camera animations that can be played at any moment in the game. The animations can be rotations over the time and/or movements over the time. Some special animations like shaking animation will be implemented too. With the animations we will also have some text that can be displayed at the bottom of the screen to describe the objectives of a mission for example.Everything will be configurable via the world editor and will be kept as simple as possible and as generic as possible to be easily scalable and integrated in the game."
Bi-gram Language Modeling ,Xapian Search Engine Library,Gaurav Arora,"Bi-gram Language modeling approach to information retrieval have proved to outperform the three traditional IR approaches .Bi-gram Language model apart from better retrieval performance renders a rich resource Bi-gram from collection which can be used for phrase searching, Diversifying search results, and query reformulation suggestion to user. Bi-gram Language model would make Xapian a more powerful library for research in information retrieval."

Advanced Library Filtering in XBMC,XBMC Foundation,Montellese,"With growing media collections it gets difficult to quickly find specific media files. For that purpose filtering can be employed which allows specifying rules to narrow down the listed media files. The goal of this project is to integrate the filtering functionality of Smart Playlists (a feature of XBMC) into the media listings available in XBMC. To take it a step further, the concept is simplified to allow to easily put together a set of properties that a user would like to filter by."
Clean scraping API,XBMC Foundation,topfs2,"One thing which makes XBMC amazing is the fact that it is able to scrape websites in order to add meta data to a file with little help from users. Up till now XBMC have used regular expressions to achieve this task, and has done so rather successfully, but it has highlighted a few limitations, amongst many they can quickly become complex and are not very resilient to changes done in the website. The current scraping API has little tests and little is known what files it actually handles (outside the hierarchy the tight community uses), nor any knowledge about what it should handle, this along with making a new and future proof API is what I propose as my project."
Improved UPnP serving and client,XBMC Foundation,Alasdair Campbell,"Despite it’s age, UPnP-AV is still the de facto standard for multimedia sharing in the home. Hundreds of products throughout millions of homes support UPnP to varying degrees. This propagation of devices represent a largely untapped potential to increase the relevancy of XBMC. Currently, XBMC operates both as a UPnP ‘media server’ and a ‘media renderer/control point’ (client), however it does not fully utilize the protocol to provide as rich as user experience as possible, and some third-party devices are incapable of streaming the content from XBMC altogether. The aim of this project is to extend the existing UPnP handling within the application, enhancing both the underlying code for the ease of future development, increasing the support for existing devices, while making great improvements to the end user’s perceptions as a whole."
XBMC Test Suite,XBMC Foundation,Andres Mejia,This proposal is to add a test suite for various components of XBMC.
An XMPP Media Server,XMPP Standards Foundation,Rodrigo Duarte,"Media sharing is a feature of prominence in various of the most used web and smartphone applications, people love to share all kind of media with other people, like at buddycloud’s “channels”, they also like to have an easy and functional way to share private work documents with colleagues, etc. The main goal of this project is build an XMPP Media Server, using standards like Jingle and Publish-Subscribe to give the XMPP and web community the opportunity to build apps that would have such feature over an XMPP infrastructure."

This project aims at adding support for conversation history through both local and remote message archiving, as well as providing the necessary user interface for browsing chat conversations. "
PubSub HTTP Interface for buddycloud,XMPP Standards Foundation,Denis Washington,"The XMPP PubSub architecture is an excellent choice for microblogging-like functionality such as buddycloud's “channels”, but unfortunately it is currently difficult to integrate into the HTTP-centered social web. This project aims to achieve the design and implementation of a bridging server that can expose XMPP PubSub nodes as HTTP resources, using standards such as Atom and PubSubHubbub, to provide interoperability between PubSub and the web."

Creating a Responsive skin for XWiki,XWiki,Jonathan Solichin,"Today, displays have been evolving on an exponential scale. From 320-1366px, there is a sundry of displays to view websites from. The goal of this project is to make XWiki accessible across all screens by manipulating size and layout of the design to best fit the context. Responsive design have the advantage of matching every size because of its fluid nature (% based), and is thus more feasible than creating specific size targets (which Responsive design still include), which changes too often."
Improve Google Android XWiki Connector,XWiki,Sasinda Rukshan,Google Android XWiki Connector was the first step for XWiki mobility. Idea is to improve on this to introduce an XWiki mobile Platform where developers can build there own applications on top of it.XWiki Mobile Platform will lie on top of current Google Android XWiki REST connector.We will have the fully functional XWiki mobile blogging application built on top of it. This will feature an android WYSIWYG text editor as a reusable UI element.
SOLR search component,XWiki,Savitha Sundaramoorthi,"The objective of this project is to exploit the Apache SOLR search engine as indexing and search engine for XWiki.XWiki is a very flexible wiki, in use in massive or small sites, with both highly structured and/or very textual content. This flexibility should be in the SOLR component: Based on SOLR's schema and complementary information, the indexing process should be customizable to only index and store as little information as needed.Through code customizability (exploiting the possibility of Groovy code in pages), the transformation of a user-query to a SOLR query should be adjustable, far beyond the simple text-parsing (enabling, for example, the prohibition of some spaces, or the conversion to multiple fields based on input parameters)Finally, this component should support calibrating the search engine's parameter (such as the Dismax' parser coefficients, the analyzers usefulness, ...) by classical quantitative methods such as precision-and-recall, which any wiki master, or a collaborator, should be able to exploit and report with."
