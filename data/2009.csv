AbiWord with GetText; AbiText?,AbiWord,Keith Bowes,"This project would implement using gettext alone for localizations.This would have advantages to both developers and translators, would reduce redundancy, etc."
Improving AbiWord’s OpenXML Support,AbiWord,frtkyk,"AbiWord is well known as one of the most useful open source word processing programs. It supports many word processing tasks to satisfy users’ needs. AbiWord is very powerful since it can easily be extended with plugins. For instance, OpenXML plugin has been very useful to many users since it allows importing and exporting Microsoft Office Word 2007 documents. However, there is still a significant amount of work to be done to improve AbiWord’s OpenXML support. In this application, I propose to improve OpenXML plugin to support a wide range of documents which can be imported and exported without any data loss."
Port AbiWord for Windows to Unicode,AbiWord,Pradeeban,"Abiword for Windows is an ANSI application, written mainly in C++. Porting Abiword for Windows completely to Unicode has been considered for a long time. Earlier researches were done to make it possible to build for both the ANSI and Unicode API. As the earlier versions of Microsoft have now become obsolete, this project targets the descendants of Windows NT and porting the existing ANSI application to a Unicode only build. The known bugs of the application are addressed in this project."
Speeding up AbiWord's table layout algorithm,AbiWord,aditya,"AbiWord currently uses GTK+'s table layout algorithm, which works well for small tables. For larger tables, it is quite slow as it uses a quadratic algorithm. In this project I propose to investigate the table layout algorithms in Firefox and OpenOffice and implement a suitable one in AbiWord. This should speed up table performance considerably, as those applications are able to handle really large tables with high speed."
 Implementing canvas-based GUI modeller of energy systems in ASCEND,ASCEND,venom,"The project aims to implement a canvas-based GUI modeller for energy systems, which enjoys significant advantages over a text-based modeller in terms of user friendliness. The current GUI modeller of ASCEND supports certain basic features, but lacks support for other essential features which are usually expected from a standard GUI modeller. I would be implementing all such vital features into the existing modeller making it more complete in terms of functionality and thus more appealing to use."
Improved ODE/DAE support ,ASCEND,dantexid,"The project implies creating a library using LINK semantics, to better describe dynamical systems. For this purpose, the Ascend language parser will need to be extended. I will use Bison, using on a context free grammar defined for this purpose, to create a C programs that parse a given input based on that grammar. Flex will also be useful to scan for specific lexical patterns in the input (a satisfactory structure for ODEs and DAEs must be defined)."
Non-proprietary Optimization,ASCEND,MNM,"ASCEND is a modeling environment with a number of integrated solvers, used to model complex engineering problems. Among others, it includes a wrapper for CONOPT - a commercial optimization tool. CONOPT a being commercial product cannot be packaged with ASCEND for free distribution and the lack of a free, good optimization tool limits the utility of ASCEND. This can be bettered by including a wrapper for IPOPT and adding support for Hessian Matrices followed by tight integration."

A distributed approach for graph spatialization,Association Gephi,Helder Suzuki,"Spatialization plays an important role in rendering networks, specially when the size of the networks are huge and the complexity of current spatialization techniques starts to dominate. This proposal is about developing and implementing a highly scalable distributed spatialization algorithm, so that Gaphi can ideally spatialize [and render] massive networks (~1M nodes)."
Extending Gephi with realtime dynamic graph navigation,Association Gephi,Julian Bilcke,"I propose to add a new graphical component to Gephi,that will use the current slice-based storage of Gephi to provide an intuitive temporal graph navigation.This implementation will be designed with performance and ease of use in mind."
Network Algorithms and Statistics ,Association Gephi,pjmcswee,"This proposal outlines and expands upon the Network Algorithms and Statistics project idea.This proposal calls for the implementation of 9 network algorithms and metrics which will enhance Gephi's user experience by providing information about the network which is not usually apparent from mere visual introspection.The proposed network metrics are: HITS, PageRank, clustering coefficient, network diameter, mean shortest path, betweenness centrality, modularity, degree-distribution and closeness centrality.Within this document I discuss the proposed network metrics and the approaches I intend to take to implement them.I propose a tentative time-line, outline appropriate milestones and discuss anticipated development hurdles and how I intend to avoid them."
Vectorial Preview,Association Gephi,Jérémy Subtil,"Gephi is able to export its network as SVG or PDF format. Using vectorial drawings for graph have many benefits like infinite zooming or clear shapes. The aim of this proposal is to develop a preview module in Gephi for seeing how the output will exactly looks like with the given parameters.Whereas the embedded 3D engine is designed for efficient network exploration the vectorial export concentrate on clarity, readability and outstanding design. This module has many different settings like edge thickness, arrow size, white borders around labels, node border and so on. In the vein of WYSIWYG editors we would like to see direct setting change on a Vectorial Preview window. The module must be scalable to support large networks.To resume there are two requirements, previewing the network exactly how it will looks-like in output and support huge graphs efficiently.An approach proposed by the mentors consists in using the output generated by the Gephi Rich SVG Export module to reconstruct and display the network. By importing the demo input ""celegans.gexf"", the generated SVG file has size 1.8MB. Building the preview from an SVG file generated each time an option is (un)checked seems to be a too loud process appearing not to be scalable for large networks, especially on old computers. Moreover, there does not seem to be a ""transitory"" state of data: data is directly exported to SVG in the ExporterSVG class.Finally, my approach is to generalize the vectorial transformation process into a class called ExporterVectorial, for instance, in which the final shape of rendering is abstracted: it will create a new transitory data set designed for a vectorial output. By (un)checking any option, ExporterVectorial will be called, generating the vectorial data that a new class VectorialPreview will render on the SVG export panel using Java 2D. When the ""Finish"" button will be pressed, ExporterVectorial will be called again and then ExporterSVG will use the output data to render it into the SVG format. In fact, SVG and preview outputs will come from a same data input designed especially for vectorial rendering. In addition, an idea could be to implement a ""Preview"" checkbox on each vectorial export panel, which would allow people using old computers to choose if they want an automatic preview or not.Nevertheless, the main interrogations are:* will the graph be displayed entirely or partially?* if displayed partially, how to browse it and make the preview readable?About the development method, a new Bazaar branch will be created from a ""rather stable"" Gephi development version, and the work will be done on it. Once the GSOC ended, it is hoped that it will be merged into the trunk branch.Here is the planning schedule:* April 20th - May 23rd: understanding of existing Gephi code, following of current development evolution;* May 23rd - June 26th: class diagram design, Java 2D API discovering, rendering few nodes in the preview window then thousands/millions to test performance;* June 27th - August 17th: proper development of the proposed approach."

Implement campaign statistics reports on stats.wesnoth.org,Battle for Wesnoth,Gregory Shikhman,"Wesnoth currently has a basic website for viewing campaign completion information at http://stats.wesnoth.org, but it is very basic. I will create a site that allows users to view campaign info with filters (ex. view all wins on Heir to the Throne on OSX). The system must quickly parse 100k+ data entries and generate graphs from them. There must also be good control over presentation of data (date range, side by side comparison for certain filters). "
Multiplayer improvements,Battle for Wesnoth,ilor,"The wesnoth multiplayer server is in need of some improvements to allow larger communities to participate. Even more so, the ""lobby"" user interface is largely inefficient and difficult to extend. This project aims to rewrite the UI part in the client for a smoother experience, and update the server-side code to match. Main expected features are a new game list with filters, a configurable room-like system, and moderation aids."
"Savegame Reorganization in ""Battle for Wesnoth""",Battle for Wesnoth,euschn,"The implementation of savegames in ""Battle for Wesnoth"" supports singleplayer, multiplayer and replays. However, the format for these types is not unified. Games are saved differently, lots of information is stored redundantly. The savegame code is spread accross multiple files and hard to maintain. Additionally, there are problems with multiplayer campaigns, which become increasingly popular in ""Wesnoth"".The goal of this project is to develop a new design of the savegame mechanism."
Clustering and MediaCloud.,Berkman Center at Harvard University,Charles Francis,"I propose two things.First, I would like to develop a suite of clustering algorithms for the MediaCloud project.I am then interested in using this suite to work at resolving a particular problem: determining and comparing the topic clusters for particular media outlets. That is, determining what topics are of greatest interest to, say, Fox News, and how this set of topics differs from that of, say, Daily Kos."
Cohort CRM: Extraction of tagging into plugin and further development,Berkman Center at Harvard University,Ryan Neufeld,"During my time with the Berkman Center I will work on developing the Cohort CRM Ruby on Rails web application.

Integration of OpenGL VBOs and vertex arrays for faster 3D Viewport rendering,Blender Foundation,Lukas Steiblys (imbusy),"One of the biggest weaknesses of Blender is the inability to render high polygon counts while modeling. I believe the way blender uses OpenGL API is the biggest cause: it does immediate mode rendering. Using VBOs and vertex arrays, sometimes called the retained mode, would speed up the rendering substantially and provide a user with a more responsive interface."

L2CAP Enhanced Retransmission Support,BlueZ,Gustavo F. Padovan,"L2CAP lies above the Link Manager and Baseband and interfaces with higher layer protocols. It passes the packet from the Link Manager to the higher layer protocols or vice-versa.L2CAP operates in five modes but BlueZ supports only L2CAP Basic Mode. My idea is to implement L2CAP Enhanced Retransmission Mode, which is an improved version of retransmission & flow control modes ( Not yet implemented on Linux)The Basic Mode doesn't support either Retransmission or Flow Control of packets. Those features will make bluetooth transfers more reliable and for the first time we will be able to retransmit corrupted packets making the bluetooth experience better on Linux. Bluetooth protocols like AVRCP will take advantages of L2CAP Enhanced Retransmission."
Boost.Python py3k support,Boost C++ Libraries ,Haoyu Bai,This project will add Python 3 support for Boost.Python. So the users of Boost.Python can migrate to Python 3 easily after this project completed. The goal is the Boost.Python library and users' codes can be compiled with both Python 2 and 3 without modification of code. So we can maintain just one version of code to provide extension module for either version of Python.
Graph Partitioning in The Boost Graph Library,Boost C++ Libraries ,balsa,"Graph partitioning is an important problem with extensive application in scientific computing, optimization, VLSI design, and task partitioning for parallel processing. My GSoC project would be to implement several graph partitioning algorithms on the existing BGL graph types, and then, depending on the availability of a hypergraph data structure, either look at partitioning algorithms on hypergraphs, or attempt to implement those partitioning algorithms in The Parallel BGL."
Porting boost.fusion to c++0x.,Boost C++ Libraries ,Christopher Schmidt,"Since the c++0x puzzle begins to take shape and a lot of developers use compiler that support at least a subset of the c++0x language, new demands are made on boost.fusion.The main goal of this project is to follow these demands and update boost.fusion so c++0x developers can use this library intuitively without ugly workarounds or potentially wasted compile time."
Relations data type,Boost C++ Libraries ,michael lopez,"The graph data type in the BGL is a container where a user defines a set of objects and indicates whether there are connections between said vertices. However, all connections between the objects within a graph are arbitrary, at least from the graph data type's point of view. This proposal is to implement an adaptor to the Graph data type based on an abstraction of relations. This adaptor will allow a user to define a condition that a pair of objects must satisfy in order to be connected."
Unicode handling,Boost C++ Libraries ,Mathias Gaunard,"This proposal aims at providing the base tools upon which a full Unicode environment can later be built, by proposing tools in a locale-agnostic context to categorize unicode code points, iteration of code points within an encoded form, as well as an unicode string type to accurately represent text."
Further OpenGL Geometry Editor GUI development,BRL-CAD,Benjamin Saunders,"I propose to continue the development of the OpenGL Geometry Editor GUI effort began during Summer of Code 2008 through modifying the existing application to take advantage of the Qt application and UI framework and then taking advantage of the wide array of development tools, widgets, and libraries offered by the framework to rapidly flesh out the front end, with the ultimate goal of preparing a powerful and intuitive CSG modeling GUI ready for connection to the geometry service."
Hybrid Representation through BREP on BREP CSG,BRL-CAD,Joe Doliner,Constructive Solid Geometry(CSG) is a procedural modeling technique that represents solids as Boolean combinations of more primitive solids.

Debian-Installer Support for GNU/kFreeBSD,Debian,slackydeb,"GNU/kFreeBSD is currently using a hacked version of the FreeBSD installer combined with crosshurd as its own installer. While this works more or less correctly for standard installations (read: the exact same installation as in the documentation), it does not allow any changes in the installation process except the hard disk partitioning. This project is about porting debian-installer on GNU/kFreeBSD, and to a bigger extent, make debian-installer less Linux dependant."
Distribution-independent update-manager,Debian,Stephan Peijnik,"The project would involve taking the distribution-(Ubuntu-)specific update-manager code, analyzing it, and creating a package with just its core functionality, decoupling the distribution-specific parts and thus making the core code extensible by distribution-specific add-ons. This in turn would remove the need of porting update-manager to Debian with every upstream release. An additional optional goal would be replacing the synaptics-backend with a python-apt based one."
MTD Embedded Onboard flash Partitioning and Installation,Debian,Per Andersson,"Many embedded devices have onboard flash [MTD] as persistent storage.Example devices: Kurobox Pro NAS (256 MB) [KURO], the Neo Freerunner (256MB) [FR], the Sheeva Plug (512 MB) [SHEEVA], and the OLPC (1024 MB).For a sane Debian installation maybe 512 MB is small, still MTD flash ispopular and capacity increases. Support for MTD partition/installationwould make Debian even more interesting to a wide range of of devices.I propose that UBI [UBI] support is added to partman."
On-demand Cloud Computing with Amazon EC2 and Eucalyptus Integration,Debian,David Wendt Jr.,"In many academic fields, as well as commercial industries, people use clusters to distribute tasks among multiple machines. Many times this is done by packaging a whole operating system disk image and running it in a VM. This project intends to make it easier for Debian to distribute prepared disk images like they distribute CD images now, for the users to recreate or customize these templates with Debian packages and for administrators to host such clusters with Debian."
Implementation of additional i18n features on Django,Django Software Foundation,Marc Garcia,"This application proposes a number of modifications on Django, with the aim of providing web developers with more tools to localize their projects.Django already provides some i18n features, but it lacks many others such as date and number formatting, and translation of dynamic content.Developments detailed in this application will make Django projects easily localized. Also these changes will be useful for implementing future i18n features, inside Django or as external applications."
Improved HTTP and WSGI Support,Django Software Foundation,Chris Cahoon,"There is a wide array of accepted tickets related to HTTP and WSGI support in Django. While some of them are minor, there are a few features that require a good deal of consideration, planning, and a fairly large set of changes to the code, but could add useful features and performance improvements for Django. There are a few tickets in particular that could be addressed. These tickets combined represent the need for additional attention paid to HTTP support in Django."
Model aware validation,Django Software Foundation,Honza Král,Tie in validation that is currently only happening in Form objects and allow for models to define their own validation logic. The idea is to define validation logic for your models along with their definition and have it propagated into their respective ModelForms. Part of this project should also be refactor of the current validation logic in Forms and abstract it so that there is no duplicity in code (models vs forms)
Multiple Database Support in Django,Django Software Foundation,Alex Gaynor,"Django current has the low level hooks necessary for multiple database support,but it doesn't have the high level API for using, nor any supportinfrastructure, documentation, or tests.The purpose of this project would beto implement the high level API necessary for the use of multiple databases inDjango, along with requisit documentation and tests."
UI improvements for the admin interface,Django Software Foundation,Zain Memon,"Ever since developers first discovered Django, the admin interface has been one of its most lauded features.

Adding RDF Support to the ApacheSolr module,Drupal,Thomas Seidl,"This project will improve the ApacheSolr module by enabling it to handle (i.e., index and search with a comfortable UI) any kind of RDF data. This will instantly make it possible to provide meaningful searches for all site content that isn't node-centric, as well as content from anywhere else on the web. Only an RDF class description and a way to access the data would have to be provided (apart from the normal Solr requirements) and the module would automatically do the rest of the work."
Automatic and Manual Conflict Resolver,Drupal,Christopher Brad,"This project focuses on handling node conflicts. Currently when a user tries to save a node that has been edited (and saved) before they have submitted, an error appears and the edit is blocked. This module aims to resolve these issues automatically if possible. If not, it will provide tools and an interface to interactively merge the two different versions of the node."
Boost Drupal Media Module Development,Drupal,Jon Stacey,"There are dozens of modules that handle multimedia in the Drupal ecosystem. This complexity has hindered module maintainers from coordinating more closely, creating duplicate work and maintenance overhead. The media module framework is an effort to unify the many existing projects. To help speed development, I will focus on the following two items from the Media module roadmap to bring the project closer to a beta release: Views integration and Token integration."
Bot module extensions and documentation,Drupal,Balazs Dianiska,"Bot module is a Drupal PHP IRC bot written by Morbus Iff. It runs on many Drupal related channels, providing various tools from code documentation to collaboration between users. It utilizes the CMS as its storage and code handling back-end, but until now not many public modules exploit the potential in this website - IRC interaction, interacting with Drupal content, site users for instance. This project will extend its core in this direction, and by writing tests and documentation for it will make further contribution easier."
Completion of Version Control Integration and Deployment to Drupal.org,Drupal,Daniel Hackney,"I will be making several changes to Drupal's Version Control System (VCS) integration to make it a viable replacement for the current CVS-only system used. The ultimate goal would be to develop alternate backends such as Subversion and Git to the point that they could be used in lieu of CVS for managing the Drupal core and the contributed modules. Additionally, I will implement web-based support for creating branches of projects, similar to <a href=""https://code.launchpad.net/bzr"">Launchpad</a>."
Drupal Social Network Framework,Drupal,James An,"Overview:Create a social framework in Drupal that ties existing contrib modules together so that Drupal social sites can be more easily rolled outMotivation:The Drupal community has built a number of contrib modules to add interactivity into multi-user Drupal sites. Aggregated, they represent most of the features needed and wanted for building a social site. Unfortunately, finding, evaluating, and integrating these modules together is very time-intensive due to the varying quality of contrib modules.Creating a social framework in Drupal will pull together these modules into a cohesive package.Goals:* Non-technical (ie. no coding knowledge) administrators should be able to roll out a social site using this framework* Where appropriate, allow admins to choose which module to implement a particular feature (ie. the various profile modules) like wysiwyg with text editors* Create custom code to bridge contrib modules together and close feature gaps unfilled by existing contrib modules* Document how the contrib modules fit together to form the framework and how custom code bridges these modules together* Create an install profile to configure the framework initially* Create an administrative section to coordinate the configuration of the different framework modules (time permitting)* Include UI and usability improvements like Popups API or Ajax submit to improve the user experience (time-permitting)"

Report Generation Tool for DSpace,DSpace Foundation,ashlymarkose,"“Report Generation” in general brings added value to any Information Management System with no exception to Institutional Repositories. Taken from an academic perspective, one of the main advantages is to generate reports based on individual authors and contribution period (e.g. Jayan, 15Feb2007-25Apr2007). In-addition, if publications (Journal e.g. JASIST (Wiley), IPM (Elsevier) or Conference e.g. JCDL, ECDL) can be segregated based on ranking it would add much value from management perspective. A summarized report in this form from various academic disciplines in Institutes of higher learning would definitely drive strong interest from the stakeholders of Institutional Repositories. Our plan is to achieve this report generation based on data extracted from the Dspace IR and present this grouped by various custom filter options such as author, contribution period, publication ranking, and summarized report for each academic discipline etc. The motivation to this proposal is based on feedback received from the academic community during a presentation that was meant for encouraging contribution into repositories. Based on our initial thoughts we plan to use ""DataVision"", an open source report writer tool for report generation and subsequent integration of the same as an add-on to DSpace. We believe that such a feature would definitely drive academic contribution to repositories keeping in mind its long-term benefits."

"EMF Web Tools: A Project to Facilitate the Generation of Domain-Specific, Browser-based, Visual Editors for 2D Graph-like Representations of EMF-based Models",Eclipse Foundation,Jacob Beard,"To lower the usability and portability threshold of the Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF), it should be possible to visually edit model instances from a standard web browser. This a task for which the GEF/Draw2d/SWT stack is not well-suited, and thus a browser-based diagram editing environment is needed. Additionally, it should be possible to use the same workflow provided by the Graphical Modelling Framework (GMF) to generate domain-specific, browser-based diagram editing environments."
Enhanced Basic SWT widgets as a part of 'Nebula',Eclipse Foundation,higer,"'Nebula' has been developed to make the widget in Eclipse rich and colorful,but the basic widgets are all the same and not enhanced. For example,the combo box widget still does not support an image item or a mix(image and text).Actually,there are many aspects for basic SWT widgets to be enhanced.If possible,I think these ""enhanced"" widgets can be a part of 'Nebula' before accepted by SWT."
Extract method revival ,Eclipse Foundation,Benjamin Muskalla,"JDT already provides several very good refactorings like Extract method. Despite the fact they are behave very good there are still some unresolved bugs and open enhancement requests. The project will take the ""Extract method"" refactoring to the next step by resolving all (possible) bugs and trying to enhance the current functionality.

REST abstraction for ECF,Eclipse Foundation,hstaudacher,"Many service providers using a REST based API to offer developers access to their services, i.e. Twitter, Facebook and so on. The result of this is that some third parties provide Java based libraries, which covers this API's. The ECF team played a little bit with the Twitter API and use therefore a library called Twitter4J. The disadvantage of this technique is a dependency to the third parties library. This means an ECF container based on such a library is dependent on the diversity of this. To decouple these dependencies an own ECF based REST abstraction should be created within this GSoC project."

OBAMPxP olsrd plugin: Multicast multimedia delivery in OLSR community mesh networks,Freifunk,Saverio Proto,"The Freifunk mesh network today does not support multicast. OBAMP is an overlay protocol: it runs only in the end-systems belonging to the multicast group. User data are distrubuted over a distribution tree formed bu a set of non-cyclic UDP tunnels.With respect to OBAMP, there is a version based on proactive routing protocol (e.g. OLSR) called OBAMPxP.OBAMPxP has been in implemented in Java to prove his feasibility, but still some critical functions (as the discovery of other nodes running the OBAMPxP protocol) have not yet been implemented.My proposed project is to implement the OBAMPxP protocol as a OLSR plugin. The OBAMPxP protocol is cross layer, exploits information from the routing protocol to create the multicast tree. Developing it as an OLSR plugin makes it easier to access the network topology information. Moreover OBAMPxP can also use the default MPR flooding functionality to advertise OBAMPxP capable nodes.Users running olsrd with the OBAMPxP plugin on their mesh nodes will be able to send and receive multimedia streams over the mesh network, optimizing bandwidth usage exploiting overlay multicast."
Service Control Module for Freimap,Freifunk,,This project aims to enhance the Freimap mesh network analysis tool by adding ability to actively interact with the network nodes through SSH channels.

Improving the DVB experience with GNOME DVB Daemon,GNOME,Sebastian Pölsterl,"The goal is to provide an easy way, well integrated into the desktop, to setup DVB devices, record and watch TV shows. The foundation was established during last year's GSoC where I implemented basic features like recording shows and scanning for channels. However, there is still a lot of work to be done so that a non-technical user can make use of my work without problems, too.The first step is to fix outstanding major bugs. Scanning for channels does currently not yield the same results on every scan. The bug might be somewhere in GStreamer's mpegtsparse element. In addition, it's currently not possible to record or watch two or more channels that are part of the same transport stream simultaneously. Only the stream of the channel that is selected first works properly, all other streams are disrupted.Although, there's basic support for watching live TV (based on gst-rtsp-server) it is a relatively new feature that hasn't seen much testing, yet. First of all, the work should be based on the latest version of gst-rtsp-server. Currently, the biggest downside is that live TV and recordings are two separate parts of the program. Because of that conflicts between live TV and recordings are not resolved. If you are watching live TV and a recording is about to start on a different channel the daemon should automatically switch to the channel of the recording.Another major goal is to better integrate GNOME DVB Daemon into Totem. Only experienced users can make use of Totem's DVB features, because you have to generate the channel list with a command line tool and place the generated file in a special place. Additionally, it's only possible to use multiple DVB adapters if they are all of the same type. DVB Daemon already addresses all of the above issues, but it is not well integrated into Totem, yet.You should be able to access all features (scanning for channels, recording/watching channels, browsing EPG and recordings) of the daemon directly within Totem. Ideally, the user just plugs in his DVB adapter and the assistant to scan for channels is started automatically if the device is not configured, yet.Furthermore, Totem should use a ring buffer when watching live TV. This allows the user to pause live TV, rewind it and fast forward later. This feature will involve work on GStreamer's queue2 element.A simple channel list editor is currently missing, too. That's especially annoying with DVB-S where you have thousands of channels but you are only interested in a small fraction of them. It should be possible to select the favorite channels after the scan is completed.In addition, I want to provide a way to aggregate EPG data from different sources with additional metadata via a plugin system. Some channels don't provide EPG data in their transport stream or the data is incomplete. Retrieving the EPG informations from an online service would obviously fix this problem and may even provide additional metadata.Last but not least, I want to add a way to schedule reoccurring recordings so you can easily record you favorite TV show."
Integrate bugzilla into pulse,GNOME,Florian Ludwig,Pulse collects data and presents them in a useful manner. It was written with the needs of the documentation team in mind but I belief it could be useful to all GNOME's contributes. IMHO integrating bug trackers with pulse would help this goal most. So this project's goal is to integrate bugs.gnome.org and work together with contributers how to do this best and what to do beyond it.

They will be designed to help developers find where the time is spent, and at these hotspots, what the processor is doing. The use of the performance tools has to be as simple and straight forward as possible. These tools will be designed to be used in a non-interactive batch manner and to produce html output meant to be used both in automatic performance-regression testing and perf tuning during development."

Developing GNOWSYS-mode,GNU Project,Divya,"Idea here is to develop GNOWSYS-mode, an application for knowledge organization in the GNOWSYS knowledge base through emacs environment. This full featured dialect of LISP programming language will allow command based authoring and modification of GNOWSYS centric knowledge entities/nodes. Thus it will materialise as an application for Getting Things Done in more structured & collaborative fashion and will work as a major-mode in emacs very similar to org-mode or Latex-mode. "
Emacs GDB/MI migration,GNU Project,Dmitry Dzhus,"The goal of this project is to migrate the GDB graphical interface inEmacs to completely use GDB's Machine Interface (GDB/MI).Currently a mixture of GDB annotations and GDB/MI are used to provideGDB UI in Emacs. Dropping deprecated annotations in favor ofmachine-oriented GDB/MI protocol will make underlying codebase morerobust and easier to maintain and improve. Switching to GDB/MI willalso allow using new features of GDB from Emacs."
Emacs Lisp support for Guile,GNU Project,Daniel Kraft,"GNU Guile includes a new VM and compiler infrastructurefor performance improvements in the current development tree.Additionally,it is designed in such a way as to allow easy extension with new languages.I would like to implement support for Emacs Lisp on top of thisframework to allow Guile to run elisp code in addition to the Schemelanguage it is based on originally; this will allow Guile to be used foran even broader context and work with a large base of existing scripts."
GDB - Python Scripting API Enhancements,GNU Project,Oguz Kayral,"There is ongoing work for integrating Python scripting into GDB. One of the most wished features PythonGdb lacks is being able to control the GDB inferior. I propose to develop an inferior control API expanding on the work by GDB developers.This feature will help in such use case:<LimCore> how to run gdb from command line, so that it will run ./foo.bin with arguments: foo bar baz and it will run it instantly without waiting for 'r'; And if program segfaults then it will do 'bt' without waiting for the command. (and if program terminates normally then it will also just quit)"
GNU Smalltalk,GNU Project,Gwenael,"The goal is to create a new user interface for the integrated development environmnent with the GTK+ Gnu Smalltalk binding.

GNU/Hurd -- VFS-style union mount,GNU Project,Sergiu Ivanov,"Implement VFS-style union mounts in the Hurd. The idea is to provide apossibility to use VFS-style union mounts under the GNU/Hurd systemvia a special translator. This would allow for flexible usage of themain filesystem and a uniform access to different types of filesystems(which could be normal filesystem and virtual, ``hurdish''filesystems).Also, implement some ``magic'' rules which would allow *controlled*union mounts; this could include translator manipulations."

Crosscompile Win32 OOo on Linux,Go OpenOffice,Jesús Corrius,"Setting up a build environment for OOo on Windows is a pain, requires expensive tools (at least when needing all features), and the IO performance of the used cygwin/msvs mix is rather disappointing. This task includes setting up, (if necessary) provide missing headers and tools, and actually performing a full cross build of OOo under Linux.Fortunately most libraries should compile out of the box, but there are some tricky parts with very specific windows code. For example, if there's code that uses ATL it will have to be rewritten because there's no way to compile that with a gcc compiler. It can be very time consuming project, because you'll have to change all the makefiles with the new crosscompile configuration with a mix of linux and windows settings. And, of course, compiling is one thing but then it has to work well. Basically:1. Creating the new configuration in the OOo build system.2. Making changes to the makefiles to target the Win32 platform.3. Provide missing headers / tools.4. Decide solutions for non-compilable code.4. Check the things compiled work as expected.5. Creating the installer."

Issue analysis with software ICU,Hackystat,Shaoxuan,"Software ICU is already a great tool for monitoring software project's health. However, one significant vital sign is missing, that is the project's ""issue"". Issue tracking system is now one of the most important and popular tools for task management. And it usually consists of formatted information that it is easy to extract information automatically for sensor data. The use of issue tracking system reflects the task management habit of a software project, which is an essential part to its success.The project will be introducing issue tracking as a vital sign in software ICU. The components need to be done includes DPD analysis of ""issue"", several telemetry analysis of issue that showing different aspect of it, and the correct coloring mechanism to demonstrate issue in a meaningful and concise way."
Master Dissertation- A middelware realising autonomous services for Hackystat,Hackystat,Hervé Weitz,"(1) Service management.We now have about six or so services that run as a standard part of a Hackystat system, with more on the way.Unfortunately, all of these services need to be configured and run individually. Also, if one goes down, we have no way to knowing.A huge benefit would be to create a framework that allows easy downloading, deployment, and monitoring of these services."
Social Network Impact on Programming Practices,Hackystat,Rachel Shadoan,"Hackystat provides numerous tools for allowing users to analyze patterns in their programming behaviors; I will build upon this functionality by adding features that will allow users to identify trends in the software development community at large.

There will also have some documentation on it.
Internationalization support for Haiku,Haiku,Adrien Destugues,"As an operating system oriented towards users, it feels strange thatHaiku has no support for internationalization and is only available inenglish. The goal of this project is to add a Locale Kit to thesystem, allowing all the bundled applications, tools and preflets tobe translated to the correct language at runtime. The translationshould be made simple with the use of a graphical tool, and the usershould be able to select his language easily when installing thesystem, then switch to another one at runtime."
Port Haiku to ARM architecture,Haiku,Johannes Wischert,"Port the Haiku Kernel and some device drivers to the ARM architecture, so that it can boot and use at least the serial console and the sd-card on a beagleboard. To fulfill this task a generic boot loader that uses u-boot (this would also help for porting to other architectures) must be written and the kernel be ported."

haskell-src-exts -> haskell-src,haskell.org,Niklas Broberg,"This project aims to improve on my haskell-src-exts library for working with Haskell source code. The goal of the project is to have haskell-src-exts supercede the haskell-src library. The main thing involved is to add a mechanism that allows the user to conditionally choose what extensions the parser should be aware of. Further, I would extend haskell-src(-exts) with functionality to handle comments and exact layout, to allow for things like automatic code generation and refactoring."
Improving space profiling experience,haskell.org,Patai Gergely,"At the present moment, heap profiling Haskell programs means analysing logs off-line, using conversion tools to visualise data. However, instead of generating graphs with hp2ps, it should be possible to present the data in a graphical application in real time, which is useful while developing interactive applications. This project aims at creating an interactive profiler as well as a Haskell reimplementation of hp2ps to resolve some long-standing issues and improve its maintainability."
Optimising Darcs for medium to large repositories,haskell.org,Petr Ročkai,"Darcs is known to have performance issues when repositories extend beyond certain size. There are several ""directions"" in which repositories grow -- out of these, size of the working tree and length of history my primary focus. Common commands involving the working tree should be comfortable to use and should not introduce delays in workflow. Moreover, big repositories should be stored efficiently and it should be possible to efficiently retrieve both full repositories and new patches remotely."
Ghost removal for enfuse,Hugin/Panotools,"Lukáš ""stativ"" Jirkovský","Thanks to Google SoC 2007 hugin got ghost removal for merging to HDR images using khan algorithm. The goal of my work would be to add ghost removal technique to the enfuse tool. This would need some changes to the current implementation interface and altering current implementation to be able to mix the weights generated by enfuse properly with weights generated by khan.As an optional goal I'd like to implement new ghost removal technique (see [2] in content)."
Layout Panorama Model,Hugin/Panotools,J. Legg,"Hugin currently is largely unaware of stacks and rows of images. I plan to let the user specify the row, column, and bracket of the images, but also try to automatically find them after alignment. They can then use this model help with optimisation of image positions and show each bracket individually in the preview windows. The information can also be used to identify image pairs that should be connected with control points."
LightTwist ,Hugin/Panotools,albiorix,"Idea is to port LightTwist to Mac OS, which would allow more people to use the application. It could also be beneficial, since Apple is having educational programs in North America, so porting it on Mac would allow to easily use it in schools (as Yuval mentioned the educational value of this project).In general, I am open to the possibility of working on any project within the Hugin/Panotools community. "
 Straight-line detection for automated lens calibration ,Hugin/Panotools,Timothy Nugent,"To correct lens distortion, Hugin requires a user to generate control points on straight lines - a time consuming process - allowing the optimiser to calculate the correct calibration parameters. Hugin should aim to automate as many difficult parts of the work flow as is possible, and given that there are a variety of efficient line detection algorithms available, the lens calibration issue should be addressed. This will allow Hugin to produce better panoramas with less distortion."
Connector Tool Improvements for Inkscape,Inkscape,Arcadie Cracan,The Connector Tool in Inkscape does not allow the user do define specific connector points and also lacks orthogonal routing of connectors.

Porting Jato to x86-64,Jato,Eduard - Gabriel Munteanu,"The x86-64 architecture is rather ubiquitous at the moment, as many personal computers currently run on such CPUs and OS support is readily available. Currently, Jato supports only 32-bit x86 CPUs, which is suboptimal when the aforementioned hardware and software support is present.This proposal aims to improve Jato by allowing it to emit x86-64 code. Along with proper documentation, the outcome will also serve as an example of how to port Jato to other CPU architectures."
Replacing Jam VM,Jato,Vegard Nossum,"Jato currently depends heavily on the Jam VM source code for class-file loading by including parts of the Jam VM source code in Jato. That was initially just a way to speed up Jato development; now it seems prudent to replace Jam VM with something else, before the dependencies are made too strong, which will only make it harder to replace in the future."

Akonadi Filtering Framework,KDE,Szymon Tomasz Stefanek,"I would like to create a complete filtering architecture for the Akonadi KDE Personal Information Management system.Filtering, in this context, stands for “applying conditional changes to the attributes of the data items coming into the akonadi server”. E-mail messages that come from a specific sender may be moved to a special folder. Other messages with a subject matching a particular regular expression might be treated as spam: beside moving them to a special folder one might want to add a “spam” tag and possibly mark them automatically as “read”.In the Akonadi architecture these operations will be performed by a filter agent process. The agent will apply a sequence of filtering rules defined in a configuration file. The configuration file, in turn, will be edited by applications by using the GUI facilities provided by a shared library.The project will focus on filtering of e-mail messages but one of the goals will be to provide a framework that is generic enough to allow easy development of filtering agents for different kinds of personal information data items."
Amarok: Finish the playlist: multilevel playlist sorting with configuration interface,KDE,Teo Mrnjavac,"The playlist view in Amarok has become much more configurable recently, allowing the user to customize the format of each item.

New tile and mipmapping engine for Krita,KDE,Dmitry Kazakov,"I would like to improve current Krita's tile engine. It has some limitations like extensive locking, inefficient way of merging layers, absence of swapping, mipmapping and good multi-threading. Therefore the project can be split into two parts: The first will improve tiles engine itself (it'll add swapping and caching subsystems, introduce new locking policy, threading). Swapping of tiles will be done through pluggable modules (classes), that will allow us to use png/tiff engines for compressing unneeded/mementoed tiles.The second part will implement mipmapping subsystem at the top of modified tiles engine. It'll make zooming much faster and will allow us to experiment with layer merging and previewing, particularly when suitable we should merge layers tile-by-tile instead of merging the whole images and we should allow filers to preview their results on scaled-down images (right on scaled-down canvas)."
New Widget Explorer,KDE,Ana Cecilia Martins,"Plasma's soul resides on Plasmoids and so it ought to be treated with love. An important concern about the delivery of these applets to the users should be ""how do we deliver such applications so that they can make the best use of it?"". These questions have been made and the answers are not all satisfactory.This proposal is all about enhancing the user experience when dealing with plasmoids - proposal of a brand new interface to be used by hundreds of users every day."
Observation Planner in KStars,KDE,Prakash Mohan,"KStars is a wonderful Desktop Planetarium and it serves as a very useful tool for Amateur Astronomers.

The project will be aimed at a small, light device with GPS capabilities that can run the Marble Desktop Globe such as the EEEPC and the interface will be optimised for this. "
Plasma Media Center Components,KDE,Alessandro Diaferia,"One of the aspects that can help making KDE even more competitve over the desktop scene is, for sure, the way it manages multimedia contents. An easy to use and, at the same time, beautiful set of tools designed to help the user manage his own media contents would represent for sure one step forward in order to meet a wider range of user needs. This goal can be achieved developing Plasma Media Center Components."
plasma: containment-mouse interaction,KDE,Chani,"In KDE3, there were a few useful menus users could have pop up when they clicked on the desktop with different mouse buttons. I want to bring this to KDE4/plasma by writing a plugin framework and some plugins that can be assigned to mouse events."
"PlasMate Editor - An editor for Plasmoids, DataEngines and Themes",KDE,Polentino,"For a DE like KDE, it's important to release software which can be used bydevelopers to create custom plasmoids, data engines and themes. This app must be simple and easy to use, and must let the developer focus on the software, not on building the right directory hierarchy, and update it every time new modifications are introduce.This is PlasMate: a simple, easy to use editor for desktop customization."
Saving and loading enhancement through metadata,KDE,Alessandro Sivieri,"The dialogs developed along this project will allow users to associate any piece of information with its type, like a letter, an article, a radio podcast and so on, and to set some properties, like related people, related projects or any other possible metadata.At the same time, he will be able to load a ﬁle, searching through previously deﬁned metadata, restricting the set of possible matches and narrowing the search more and more, until he ﬁnds what he is looking for."
Smoke Generator based on Roberto Raggi's C++ parsers,KDE,Arno Rehn,"Rewrite the code generator for 'Smoke', the libraries on which many of the KDE bindings are based, using one of Roberto Raggi's C++ parsers (used at Qt Software and in KDevelop). The current code parsing and generation system is based on Perl and requires many tweaks and hacks to produce compilable code and has to be adjusted with every new Qt/KDE release. The new generator shouldn't need that anymore. The goal would be to get the Qt classes to generate and to compile. If it all goes well the KDE classes could be included, too.In the end people should be able to auto-generate bindings for their own C++ classes, just like they can run 'moc' on their Qt/KDE project."
Static Code Visualization in KDevelop,KDE,Sandro Andrade,"This project aims to implement better approaches for program comprehension and developer interaction with software artefacts in KDevelop by means of code visualization mechanisms. For that purpose, I will introduce features for control flow graphs and polymetric visualization, implemented as part of an extensible framework that will facilitate the future development of new visualization paradigms (treemaps, class/package dependency, dynamic, evolution etc)."

VoIP client for KDE (revive KCall),KDE,George Kiagiadakis,"KDE has never had some good software for communication with audio and video. As technology is evolving, there is a higher demand for communication means like this. Most KDE users nowadays use alternatives like ekiga and skype to communicate with their friends with audio and video. This project aims at addressing this need and thus creating a VoIP client software for KDE that supports audio and video communication with other people and that makes use of the telepathy framework."
Weather support and enhanced plugin features for Marble,KDE,Bastian Holst,"On the Internet are several sources of weather information. This includes current weather and weather forecasts. This project will be about adding a plugin to Marble that fetches weather information from the internet and displays it on the Marble globe. This will look like weather forecasts in tv news, but the user can select any possible map section himself. Making the plugin configurable will require several changes to Marble's plugin system."
WYSIWYG editors support in KHTML,KDE,Vyacheslav Tokarev,"The next version of HTML standard (HTML5) brings a new feature: What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editors support. It's already widely used on the web for different rich text editing (wordpress, gmail, etc). The default KDE layout engine, KHTML, is currently not good at supporting editing features.

Adding Static Profiling Capabilities to LLVM,LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,Andrei Rimsa,"The project goal is to augment LLVM with static profiling capabilities. Static profiling will help the compiler to identify which parts of a program are executed more frequently. Therefore the compiler can spend more resources in order to optimize these specific parts. In addition to this implementation, we will use it to enhance the linear scan register allocator used in LLVM, so that when necessary to spill variables, the allocator will choose those variables that tend to be the least used."
Auto-vectorization for LLVM,LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,Andreas,"The goal of this project is to implement a minimal end-to-end loop-based auto-vectorization system for LLVM. Auto-vectorization is a well-researched topic with numerous dependencies on other analysis and transformation passes, so a significant part of the proposed project is to evaluate already-available LLVM passes regarding their applicability to support auto-vectorization and to add what's missing. Special emphasis will be given to loop-dependence analysis."
Simulating Static Single Information Form in LLVM,LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,Andre Tavares,The Static Single Information (SSI) form is an extension of SSA form which has the additional property that each definition of a variable will be used only along one path of the control flow graph of the program. The SSI representation is a central part of many different analysis and optimizations that are used in the back end of compilers.

Ajax Statistics module,Melange,Mario Ferraro,Melange is now the heart web app which manages Google Summer of Code (and which will manage GHOP). The program counts every year thousands of students and mentors coming from all over the world. Handling all this data is an awesome opportunity to have great visual representations of this special open source nursery. What I would like to do is developing a statistics module to let all these cold numbers and data relationships come out from binary code to eyecandy.
Implementation of Task-based GHOP-like work flow.,Melange,Madhusudan.C.S," I wish to implement a task-based work flow for Melange, where the program administrator, organization admin and mentors willbe able to define tasks, tag them, set difficulty levels and track students' progress for each task. Also students will be able to lookat tasks, claim them, work on them, indicate their progress for tasks claimed and submit their work. Also I wish to provide Melange some automated features for processing student submissions and selection of students for prizes."

I think that adding some new statistic features is important for Melange and I also believe that I will cope with designing and implementing a proper solution that Melange will actually use. I am sure this presentation is not perfect and I would be extremely grateful for any kind of comments.
Towards a better inotify extension,Mercurial (a member of the Software Freedom Conservancy),Nicolas Dumazet,"The inotify extension relies on Linux file system event notification features to provide a fast access to the directory state: registering the watched directories with inotify, it is able to keep track of the repository status without walking the repository itself. This extension greatly improves performance on large repositories.It is however still experimental, and lacks support for windows and Mac OS.My project is to improve inotify extension reliability, and to port it to Mac Os."
"Implement the ""Next Generation Schema"" for the MusicBrainz database",MetaBrainz Foundation,Ollie,"The current MusicBrainz database is starting to become too restrictive, and a new database schema - NGS - has been designed to help solve current problems. While this new schema evolution has been talked about within the community, no real effort has yet begun on implementing the system. I propose to provide work on NGS by revamping the edit system of MusicBrainz to support the new editing possibilities NGS will bring, and also provide support work to aid developers working on NGS."
Redesign of the MB database schema,MetaBrainz Foundation,Lukáš Lalinský,"The idea is to change the schema of the MusicBrainz database, preprare upgrade scripts and backendcode to handle read/write operations on this schema. On top of this, I'd like to build a basic webinterface for all operations necessary to maintain the database."
Acceptance Tests,Mifos,Johan Hilding,"To ensure that every build of the Mifos project remains free from regressions I propose to implement a new set of Build Validation Tests (BVTs). I will also model key features of every page in its page object (see http://code.google.com/p/webdriver/wiki/PageObjects for more information about page objects) to enable more in-depth testing and make further test-writing easier."

Writing /proc and /dev File Systems,MINIX 3,Alen Stojanov,"MINIX 3 does not yet have a /proc file system that provides information about processes. In this project, I will implement a new file-system server that populates the /proc directory with per-process information. Second, MINIX 3 currently allocates all device nodes statically on the root device. I will implement a new /dev file-system server that provides an interface for the drivers to dynamically register their devices and modify the system to use it."
Improve integration of the new storage code and provide a new SQLAlchemy backend,MoinMoin Wiki,Christopher Denter,"As of last years GSoC, MoinMoin got a new abstraction layer for storage of data. That storage layer is not yet fully integrated.This proposal aims to improve the situation by adding things like support for ACLs and a routing middleware that can be used to set up different backends for different 'namespaces'.Additionally, a new backend will be provided that uses the SQLAlchemy library to store data in one of several supported database formats (SQLite, Postgres, MySQL, ...)."
"Modular group handling, output of xapian search results and rights visualization plugin",MoinMoin Wiki,Dmitrijs Milajevs,"The first project is Modular group handling. Currently, information about groups is stored in group pages. Some users need opportunity to use external storage for groups. This allows them to integrate MoinMoin with a company database.

Application to participating in Mysql projects,MySQL,LlmL,"I've been desiring contribution to open source projects for a long time. Only because I have to concentrate on my academic business for the first three years in my university and can not spare enough time on open source projects, I did not pay much attention to them before. I've adopted MySQL as the DBMS in some of my projects and am strongly willing to make MySQL better in future. So I'll appreciate granting me the chance to participate in GSoC on MySQL projects.I am very interested in the following ideas:1. A Rewrite of the Pool of Threads Scheduler (which interests me the most)2. Implement memcache support for mod_ndb 3. MySQL Sandbox.4. MySQL Server parallel filesort"
Change Tracking of Data and Structure,MySQL,zahra,"This proposal is to work on adding the ""Change Tracking"" functionality for PHPMyAdmin.The functionality would help the developer of the phpMyAdmin to migrate changes from one place to another by just pressing the synchronization button.The changes being done in a table could be adding/removing/ updating tuples,creating/dropping tables, changing schema and maintaining table evolution from state A to B. "
Drizzle Code Cleanup and C++ Standardization,MySQL,nlw,"Re-factoring is a significant focus of Drizzle at the moment. The developers have already identified 7 custom containers that can be replaced. My proposal is to take one, the various list implementations, and replace all occurrences with std::list or whichever container best suits the usage scenario. This alone was deemed to be a summers worth of work by the potential mentors. If the task is finished ahead of schedule, at least 6 other containers can be re-factored as well."

New Implementation of INFORMATION_SCHEMA,MySQL,Padraig O'Sullivan,"This project will involve the re-implementation of INFORMATION_SCHEMA. The current information schema implementation experiences performance problems due to its design and implementation. For instance, there is extra overhead during execution due to the fact that the current implementation uses SQL derived tables internally. This new implementation of information schema is desired by the Drizzle community as it is needed so that the developers can standardize on a handler interface easily. Performance problems caused by the current information schema will also be alleviated by this new implementation. Also, I see this project as something which is a perfect fit for a project with a 3-month time-frame."
phpMyAdmin Import Improvements,MySQL,Derek Schaefer,"phpMyAdmin can export databases into far more formats than it can import. First, I will extend the import framework to allow for multiple table creation, column type and title detection, as well as other functions conducive to making the framework powerful and generalized enough to handle a wide array of formats. I will then create parser modules for several formats which will utilize these additions. These changes would substantially enhance the convenience of phpMyAdmin for a great many users."

Sandpiles,Portland State University,Bryan Head,"The sandpile model is an automaton played on an arbitrary graph that gives rise to remarkable dynamic and algebraic properties. Originally proposed by Bak, Tank, and Wiesenfeld at the Sante Fe Institute to demonstrate self-organized criticality, Dhar demonstrated that the so-called recurrent configurations of a generalization of their model has a group structure. The sandpile model has since become a vibrant area of research,bringing together complex systems studies with graph theory, grouptheory, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry. Until now, however, no software has been developed that simulates the sandpile model on arbitrary graphs. The aim of this project, then, is to create a research-grade software package to fill this void."
Seamlessly Integrating Projected Images with Chalkboard Lectures,Portland State University,Dan Lidral-Porter,"I would create a free, open-source application that would allow anyone with a projector, webcam, and a computer to seamlessly integrate graphs, pictures, or any other image into lecture notes written on a chalkboard. This would be most applicable to the teaching of multivariable mathematics, where 3D graphs often help students grasp the concepts involve, but the difficulty of drawing said graphs limits their use in lectures."

P2P Synchronization of Shana Servers,Sahana,Hasanat Kazmi,"Syncing Sahana Servers has been discussed recently on sahana-dev. It is basically about syncing different instances of Sahana server which have been deployed by an organization.Syncing two Sahana servers is basically about syncing their databases. It cannot be simple database dump because we also have different database semantics at SahanaPHP and SahanaPy. So first I'll create a module in SahanaPy which exports database as in SahanaPHP. The idea is to build upon presently exporting mechanism. I will also extend Synchronization module in each Sahana server to add automatic synchronization by adding a new feature called 'Sync Pool' (As shown in diagram). It will basically list all those pools which that instance of Sahana belongs to. A user (admin) can join new pools, edit the relationship with different pools (like type of data to import, time lag for each sync attempt etc).Software which implements Zero Configuration runs continuously in the background. It has a search mechanism which is implemented by two tasks, 1: It exposes services with the name of all those pools which the instance of Sahana has subscribed to. 2: It 'searches' all those Sahana instances which have also subscribed to its pools. Once it finds servers which are in the same pool as it is, it fetches their database using Synchronization methodologies currently present (HTTP GET/POST). User can also specify server by IP/URL. Then it parses the XML and adds unique records in the database. At the time of installation, software needs to know administrative password of database."

This involves expanding thedictionaries with closed class words and adjectives, making transferrules for the structurally different noun phrases and improvingcoverage of the translation dictionaries."
Apertium-sv-da: Machine translation between Swedish and Danish,The Apertium Project,mkrist,I'm a pharmacy student from Denmark interested in languages and computers. I would like to develop the Swedish-Danish language pair for the Apertium Project.
Conversion of Anubadok: Building an English-Bengali Language Pair For Apertium,The Apertium Project,Abu Zaher Md. Faridee,Anubadok is an experimental English-to-Bengali machine translation system developed by G M Hossain. I'm going to port the existing Anubadok system to the framework of Apertium. I plan to implement a Bengali morphological generator. The tagging system also needs to be standardized and then a new transfer system can be written. I think Apertium’s flexible framework will allow me to implement a language pair as good as Anubadok. 
Highly scalable web service architecture for Apertium ,The Apertium Project,Víctor Manuel Sánchez Cartagena,"Web services application that allows programmers to access, in their desktop or web applications, the same operations that can be done with a local installation of Apertium. It is intended to support high loads by scheduling and prioritizing pending translations according to server-side resources available, and load balancing across a static or dynamic amount of servers. The availability of highly scalable web services for Apertium will catalyze its worldwide adoption."
Implement a Trigram Tagger for Apertium and support-tools for training it,The Apertium Project,Zaid Md. Abdul Wahab Sheikh,"To implement the the part-of-speech tagger using 2nd order hidden Markov model and Viterbi algorithm, and the various training algorithms: maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), Kupiec's method, Baum-Welch expectation maximization, Parameter smoothing (state-to-state transition and emission probabilities)Tools to train the trigram tagger based on both source and target language information.Integrate Baum-Welch and supervised methods implemented in att-tools into Apertium bigram tagger."
Java port of Apertium lttoolbox proposal,The Apertium Project,Rah,"The Apertium project works on open-source machine translation and language technology. If apertium is to work on platforms such as mobile phones one day, lttoolbox must be ported to java. I have found an XML java library that works similarly as the libxml2 used in lttoolbox C++ version. It will make it easy to use the existing java code."
Multi-Engine Machine Translation,The Apertium Project,shw,I would like to achieve a MEMT program that uses MOSES and statistical merging with Apertium during the other half of the GSoC period. The goal is to provide better translations for all languages but I will particularly work with Welsh-English.
native distributed rendering via network system and dedicated render server,The Aqsis Team,dan_zero,I propose an integrated distributed rendering system across a network to distribute and reassemble aqsis render jobs without the assistance of third party software. This system will allow acceleration of rendering and increase scalability.
Optimization of Dicing Algorithm in the Aqsis Renderer,The Aqsis Team,trevdavlo,"As a Reyes renderer, Aqsis relies on dicing scene primitives into micropolygons which create all surface detail.While this method can produce rendered scenes of photographic quality with greater efficiency than previous raytracing methods, a robust dicer implementation must be flexible enough to efficiently dice any degenerate geometry presented to it.I propose to refactor the Aqsis dicing module with specific optimizations in mind, rewriting critical sections where necessary."
Asterisk Data Storage API,The Asterisk Project,Brett Bryant,"The goal of this project is to organize all of the ways that Asterisk stores data, and provide a generic API for accessing and updating the data while an instance of asterisk is running. This project will focus on storing the data and keeping it available in memory. The specific implementation and project details can be discussed in detail at the start of the Google Summer of Code project."
CLI filtering,The Asterisk Project,Clod Patry,"Currently in Asterisk CLI, there's no way to debug real-time a specific channel.This causes a lot of problems, cause when you're having more then 10 channels on your system, it's really hard to track-down a specific channel.This project is to implement a channel-specific filter in the CLI.This is also to switch from the single verbose level to a multiple verbose level.Here's a link which contains more details:http://www.asterisk.org/node/48443"
Generic data export/retrieval API.,The Asterisk Project,eliel,"Create a generic ""data get"" layer for Asterisk components to be able to expose data that they maintain. Currently, modules implement specific code to implement CLI commands, manager interface actions, and so forth, while it would be much nicer to have this data available through a common interface being exported and retrieved using this API."
"Foci, web stats project.",The Codehaus,Tuomas Hämäläinen,"Improving and extending the Foci web stats application, which has the core logic in place, but there's still work to be done on the interfaces and on the performance to allow it to withstand heavy loads."
Google Summer of Code 2009 Proposal – Castor JPA Compliance,The Codehaus,Lukas Lang,"The Castor project is a quite popular and ongoing data binding and persistence framework. It demonstrates its strength in a wide variety of usage scenarios, embedment in powerful frameworks and a highly participating community. This project intends to implement Java Persistence API interfaces (excluding JPA annotation support and JPA query language) to allow developers the usage of Castor as a JPA persistence provider in a Java environment."
Groovy on Android,The Codehaus,Hjalmar Ekengren,"Currently, Groovy is not able to run on Google's Android mobile platform. The goal of this GSoC project is to work with the Groovy core team towards the goal of making any Groovy program to run on the Android platform, so that apps for such mobile phone can be written fully in Groovy."
Nokogiri JRuby support,The Codehaus,Serabe,"The work will consist on finishing Nokogiri JRuby support and help in other libraries people is using, like ar-jdbc and RMagick (the last one, continue with RMagick4J and explore the possibility of a ffi-based library)."
Refactor generation of SQL queries,The Codehaus,GSOC_Hassan,"Castor is an Open Source data binding framework for Java. It provides Java-XML binding and Java-SQL Persistence etc. The object query language supported by Castor is very limited. Castor uses descriptor classes at every step of query construction and for fetching of results which is an overhead and second problem is to keep the SQL column list passed, to be in synchronization with the sequence of columns in the resultset. To address these problems, there is a need to standardize the query engine"
GSOC2k9@TOR: TorButton Feature Fulfillment,The Electronic Frontier Foundation/The Tor Project,Kory,"I would like to work on the TorButton Firefox Extension. There are many feature requests, but I plan to focus on three of them. According to Google Summer of Code, I have ten weeks to complete my project. My plan is to spend three weeks on each feature request, leaving the last week for cleaning up code, finalizing documentation, and tying up any other loose ends. If I end up ahead of schedule, I will either work on adding another feature or I will work on fixing reported bugs."
Polipo Portability Enhancements,The Electronic Frontier Foundation/The Tor Project,chrisd,"Adapting Polipo to depend upon the libevent library, making use of its event loop, asynchronous DNS resolver and utility library, will allow us to simplify Polipo, while increasing maintainability and portability in the process. Polipo's behavior on Windows should be improved by adding support for the Windows registry to learn key path names, and by adding a launcher to run in the systray, providing the user with options to control the server."
Translation wiki for the Tor website,The Electronic Frontier Foundation/The Tor Project,Runa A. Sandvik,"The Tor project uses wml for the website and Pootle to handle translations for various projects like Torbutton and Vidalia. To make it easier for translators, translating the website should be possible via Pootle. I intend to use the po4a framework to convert the wml files to po files (and back) so that they can be handled by Pootle."
Using Bittorrent for Content Distribution in Thandy,The Electronic Frontier Foundation/The Tor Project,Sebastian Hahn,"Thandy is the secure software updater developed by the Tor projectto assist users with keeping their Tor related software up to date.I intend to resolve one of the issues that prevent deployment asof now, which is the content distribution issue. To achieve thisgoal, I will include libtorrent in Thandy; as well as set up aTracker with the ability to learn about new Thandy packages."
web.py-based GUI for Switzerland,The Electronic Frontier Foundation/The Tor Project,Caden,Create a web.py-based GUI for Switzerland.This would be a new feature of Switzerlandwhich could focus renewed attention on the project.The GUI would be used to launch the various tests in the Switzerland tool and view the results.It could also be used to view aggregated results over time.
Enlightenment Compositing,The Enlightenment Project,guinness,"A brief description of myself, the project I would like to do for enlightenment during the summer of code 2009 and the reasons why I should be picked."
Eupnp – Bringing UPnP support into E,The Enlightenment Project,André Dieb Martins,"The Enlightenment Project currently has no support to the UPnP protocol. The actual market is increasingly deploying UPnP-enabled devices, such as set top boxes, media players, routers, firewalls and a whole more. However, these devices are demanding more control tools, named Control Points.This project's goal is to implement a Control Point library for the Enlightenment Project."
exebuf extension for quicksilver/'anything' like functionality,The Enlightenment Project,Hannes Janetzek,"My idea is an extension of exebuf to make it a universal tool for searching and selecting files and running them with appropriate programs. As a rough sketch my plan is to provide interfaces for pluggable backend modules to retrieve files via locate or tracker and backends that provide actions to act on files like looking up matching applications that can open a given mimetype or sending them. For the view my idea is to have virtual folders in efm that shows the found candidates to act on."
Application-Specific Audit Trails,The FreeBSD Project,marinosi,"Audit is a critical element in operating system security evaluation.With this project an effort will be done to design and implement an application audit system, that will allow application-specific security events to be recorded and managed with an efficient, reliable and trustworthy way.That could be a great addition to the current TrustedBSD project, as it will allow sysadmins to monitor application related security events and consequently enhance application-centric security evaluation. "
BSD-licensed libiconv in base system,The FreeBSD Project,Gábor Kövesdán,"The libiconv library is an important piece of I18N software. It implements library routines to convert files from one encoding to another. There is also a command line interface for this library, which provides a convenient way of encoding conversion. Currently, FreeBSD lacks of these pieces of software in the base system. In the Ports Collection, we use GNU libiconv but this is such an underlying tool that we should have an own, customized version that is:* Located in the base system. Currently, we can't use libiconv from the base system and it is a big limiting factor in I18N.* Licensed under BSDL (preferably 2-clause).* Efficient.* Clean. Does not contain a lot of platform-specific ugly hacks. It is optimized to FreeBSD and its coding conventions.* Supports the most important encodings, the more the better, but it must support the following ones: ASCII, ISO8859-family, UTF-family, CP1131, CP1251, ISCII-DEV, ARMSCII-8, SJIS, eucJP, PT154, CP949, eucKR, CP866, KOI8-R, KOI8-U, GB18030, GB2312, GBK, eucCN, Big5HKSCS, Big5. These are the encodings that are supported by our locale subsystem, so an acceptable level of their support is a requirement.* Provides a good level of compatibility with its GNU counterpart. This doesn't only mean standard conformance, but implementing the most common extensions so that we can use it as a drop-in replacement for the Ports Collection, as well."
Design and Implementation of Subsystem Support Libraries for Monitoring and Management,The FreeBSD Project,PÁLI Gábor János,"This project is about creating wrapper libraries to support monitoring and management applications to avoid direct use of the FreeBSD kernel memory interface.This approach would allow the kernel implementation to change and monitoring applications to be extended without breaking applications and requiring them to be recompiled.For this project, we propose to provide such a library for the network and process functions (i.e. libnetstat and libprocstat)."
FIFO Optimizations,The FreeBSD Project,Zhao Shuai,Both FIFO and pipe are ways for interprocess communication. FIFO and pipes are similar in many aspects and it is likely that the FIFO implementation can be merged with pipe implementation. I would like to do this for FreeBSD.
Geom-based Disk Schedulers,The FreeBSD Project,fabio,"This project aims at introducing a framework for pluggable diskschedulers in GEOM, available to the user as a GEOM class, withscheduling algorithms implemented in external modules.We have already implemented a prototype for the framework and wealready have some example schedulers.The ultimate goals of thisproject will be to produce a stable scheduling framework andat least a general purpose disk scheduling plugin, suitable foruse under desktop workloads."
Hierarchical Resource Limits,The FreeBSD Project,Edward Tomasz Napierała,"The project is to extend current resource limits so that they can be specified not only per-proccess, but also per-user, per-job and per-jail.Idea is somewhat similar to the resource management scheme used in SunOS.It should make life easier for administrators of machines where users have access to shell account, such as shared hosting servers or university machines."
Implement TCP UTO,The FreeBSD Project,Fang Wang,"The objective of the project is to implement TCP UTO(User Timeout Option, defined by RFC 5482) in FreeBSD's TCP stack. The TCP user timeout controls how long transmitted data may remain unacknowledged before a connection is forcefully closed . RFC 5482 specifies a new TCP UTO option that allows one end of a TCP connection to advertise its current user timeout value andprovides advice to the other end of the TCP connection to adapt its user timeout accordingly."
Improving Second Extended File system (ext2fs) and making it GPL free.,The FreeBSD Project,Aditya Sarawgi,The Ext2 or extended file system is a file system developed by Rémy Card and others for the Linux kernel. The ext2fs or it's derivatives are used as the Linux operating system's native file system format today. Ext2 is still preferred on flash drives as it requires fewer write operations (since it has no journal). FreeBSD has had Ext2 support for a long time. The current implementation suffers from some problems and it's GPL'd. 
In kernel stackable cryptographic filesystem (ownfs),The FreeBSD Project,Gleb Kurtsov,"FreeBSD supports only whole filesystem encryption at device level (withGELI or GBDE), but lacks in kernel cryptographic filesystem that can beused transparently atop of other filesystem. Some progress has been seenhere recently with userlevel cryptographic filesystems, but userlevelimplementations are slow and relay and 3rd party software not includedin base system (namely fuse kmod and library). I propose to implement inkernel cryptographic filesystem utilizing stackable VFS layers (likenullfs+crypto)."
Ipfw and dummynet improvements ,The FreeBSD Project,marta,"The microinstruction-based architecture of ipfw stimulated the addition of many new operations and features over the last few years. Individually, each of these additions is a small piece of code, but the overall result is that ipfw source code (both kernel and userland) has grown significantly, leading to very large source files and functions that are not in line with good engineering practices.In this project I plan to revise the ipfw and dummynet code with following goals:+ split the kernel source in more manageable parts, similarly to what was done recently for the userland part;+ clearly separate userland-visible headers from private kernel parts;+ split a very large function, ipfw_chk(), using a dispatch table for microinstructions;+ profile the execution time of ipfw_chk, figuring out how the dispatch table affects performance, and whether some performance can be gained by reenginering the code;+ make the userland-kernel interface more efficient;+ identify the locking issues (specifically, identify any races or performance problems when adding/removing rules, when updatingcounters, when reading the ipfw state from userland);+ build the microinstruction compiler as a library so other programs can use it as well;+ verify the behavior of the userland program /sbin/ipfw, trying to make it more robust and predictable in presence of malformed input."
ipfw ruleset optimization and highlevel rule definition language,The FreeBSD Project,Tatsiana Elavaya,"ipfw has very flexible internal structure due to representing rules asa series of opcodes.But complex ipfw rulesets tend to become a mazeof goto's (skipto opcode) and hard to administrate. I propose to addsupport for highlevel domain specific language for specifying ipfwrules. As rules generated by such translator are going to containexcessive checks I propose to implement ruleset optimization.Optimizer doesn't depend on highlevel parser and would be useful onits own."
IPv6 Secure Neighbor Discovery - native kernel APIs for FreeBSD,The FreeBSD Project,anchie,"Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is the essential part of the IPv6 stack. The Secure Neighbor Discovery protocol (SeND) [rfc3971] counters threats to NDP. This project aims for the design of the efficient and portable SeND implementation. Its goal is to implement a new userspace-kernel API for SeND, which will mitigate overhead associated with netgraph and Berkley Packet Filter used in the existing FreeBSD SeND implementation."
"Package tools rewrite via a new package library, with new features",The FreeBSD Project,David Forsythe,"The collection of package tools that ship with FreeBSD have been recommended for a code cleanup and the addition of new features like package versioning and complete packages.Adding new features to the tools in their current state would just add new hacks to old code, so I propose a complete rewrite of the package tools, fascilitated by creating and completing a library for handling packages, which would contain new features while maintaining compatibility with the current package system."
Ports license infrastructure (part 2: integration),The FreeBSD Project,Alejandro Pulver,"This project involves delivering a working solution to the licensing problems in FreeBSD for the end of this SoC, such as automatically identifying GPLv3 ports, restricted distfiles, incompatible licenses, etc.It consists on committing the (already working) code from the start with minimal/normal functionality, and enabling advanced features (which are automated) later, when the respective requirements are met (i.e. FOSSology works on FreeBSD)."
puffs (pass-to-userspace framework file system) port for FreeBSD,The FreeBSD Project,Tatsiana Severyna,"Currently FreeBSD has limited support for userlevel file systems withGPL licensed fuse port (fusefs-libs) and kernel module(fusefs-kmod). There are some known design drawbacks inthis implementation which can't be easily fixed.I'd like to port puffs (Pass-to-Userspace Framework File system) fromNetBSD. I'd suggest not to preserve compatibility with NetBSD, but todevelop a port preserving FreeBSD native VFS interface and fixlibrefuse and ported userlevel file systems (psshfs)."
TCP\IP Regression Testing Suite,The FreeBSD Project,Zach Riggle,"Last year, another GSoC'er worked on a project that allows developers to rapidly craft individual packets with a very fine level of detail.The framework will be extended to allow the testing of various TCP/IP stack states and corner cases.This will effectively result in the re-implementation of TCP stack fragments in user-space, and testing the test fragments against the actual TCP stack. The resulting suite will be used to prevent regression errors in the TCP\IP stack."
USB improvements under FreeBSD,The FreeBSD Project,sylvestre gallon,"The aim of this project would be to improve the usb into freebsd. To do it I will add support for libusb v1.0 api, improve the usb function subsytem, write some manpages and implement some USB function drivers."
Freenet: trust-based distributed indexing,The Freenet Project,infinity0x,"In a non-hierarchical network, trust is an effective method of security against malicious disruptions. Freetalk & FMS are messaging systems backed by a web of trust (WoT) over crypto-identites (IDs). Each ID has a trust list which determines its interaction with other IDs; this interaction also feeds back into the trust system. This project aims to implement a similarly-backed decentralised indexing service, providing search-querying & name-resolution, allowing content to be found much faster."
Improving friend-to-friend interaction,The Freenet Project,ljb,"Freenet allows friends to be added as darknet connections. This is optional and doesn't give many benefits to the end user.An important part of getting the darknet to grow is to give benefits to the users that have darknet friends added. The benefits could either be new features or improvements in performance. The goal of the project is to implement such features and improvements in performance."
Progress indicators for loading files in FProxy,The Freenet Project,Mike Bush,"Progress bars will allow users to know whether the item they have requested has been found and, if it has, what stage of download and how big it is.Additionally I would like to work on improvements to XMLSpider indexing to improve search features."
Student Proposal for “Content filter” listed on the idea page,The Freenet Project,kurmiashish,"I have deep interest in computer security. I know basics of exploits, vulnerabilities and other security concepts. I am eager to learn new concepts. I visit security websites like governmentsecurity, hackinthebox etc regularly.I think freedom of speech is our right and Freenet provides the same.Given the opportunity, I assure you that I would give my level best and certainly meet the time bound targeted objectives to the satisfaction."
Web interface improvements,The Freenet Project,sashee,Improve the web interface significantly by introducing server pushing technologies.
ajax web interface for Globus Toolkit services,The Globus Alliance,Fugang Wang,"This project is to develop a set of JavaScript API that enables accessing Globus from a web client using Ajax technologies. The framework is based on Service Oriented Architecture and will be consist of a backend service that mediates service requests to Globus toolkit, as well as a web client that is able to access the web service through Ajax technologies.Upon the completion of this project a Grid developer or user could interact with Grid that is using Globus from inside a web browser."
Develop a GUI for GridWay,The Globus Alliance,Srini,"Current Gridway environment does not provide users with a Graphical interface for monitoring and submitting jobs. The changes can be made using GTK+ or The GIMP Toolkitwhich will use the existing infrastructureof DRMAA API (C bindings). The existing command line interfaces will be supported in Graphical User Interface so that users would be able to compose,manage,synchronise and control their jobs just by clicking the graphical interface instead of the commands."
"Develop a new 'sync' feature for GridFTP client, globus-url-copy.",The Globus Alliance,Shruti Jain,"Add a 'sync' feature to globus-url-copy for optimizing data transfer required for synchronizing the source and destination files. It minimizes the amount of data transferred by sending only the changed or required sections of the file. This helps in effective bandwidth utilization by avoiding redundant data transfers and reduces the time taken for synchronization."
"Distribution of computing jobs among different clouds (Nimbus, AWS)",The Globus Alliance,Jan-Philip Gehrcke,"Until now a proof-of-principle jobsystem was developed for ATLAS computing (LHC at CERN, Geneva) using Amazon Web Services. The idea is to make the system compatible to Nimbus. Then it would be possible to easily distribute jobs among different clouds. Additionally, the implementation of GANGA (delivering a standardized job description language) into the system would be convenient."
Globus XIO Checksum Driver,The Globus Alliance,Mattias,"This project aims to produce a driver for Globus XIO that will checksum data streams. The driver will have two modes of operation:1) Checksum the stream of data as it passes through the driver and report the final value on close. The endpoints will then verify out-of-band that the checksums match.2) Checksum each block of data and add the checksum to a block header before it is transmittet. If the checksums do not match the driver will either close the connection or request retransmit."
GridWay + GoogleMaps web interface,The Globus Alliance,Carlos Martín,"The goal will be to develop a web interface with a geographical representation of the GridWay resources using a GoogleMaps mashup, including useful information such as statistics of usage, workload, pending jobs, queue size, etc.It will also contain options so the user can filter and select which information is relevant (where are the user's active jobs, or what is the situation of the submitted jobs...). This map could be also used as an interface to submit new jobs to certain hosts."
Multiple Cluster support for Nimbus,The Globus Alliance,Adam,"The Nimbus software does not have the capability to schedule requests across multiple clusters providing cloud resources, as highlighted in Globus project idea ""ClusterBuilder: Distributed Virtual Environments over the Clouds"". The summer project involves 2 parts. Part 1 will create a tool to publish information about the Nimbus cloud resources at a particular site to a registry (likely Globus MDS). Part 2will be the creation of a tool to schedule requests to multiple Nimbus clouds."
Performance characterization of GridFTP on 10+ Gigabit networks using hosts with 10 Gigabit network interface cards,The Globus Alliance,Jamie Schwettmann,"In this project, I will characterize the performance of Globus GridFTP transfers over both TCP and UDT protocols for hosts connected at 10Gb/s over a wide area network, and compare the performance of GridFTP using each. Standard disk-to-disk GridFTP transfers will be tested, as well as memory-to-memory transfers. Characterization will include detailed measurements regarding the speed and latency involved in the transfers, as well as resource utilization at the source and destination hosts."
PSK Globus XIO driver,The Globus Alliance,melissa,"A large amount of research into security protocols to find the best to establish that a pre-shared key is known by both communicating endpoints, and research into different encryption techniques to ensure data integrity.Writing the XIO driver in C so that it accepts or rejects a connection based on the key.Writing an additional protocol which checks that both sides have the same pre-shared key once the connection has been made."
The Taverna plug-in for constructing CQL queries to caGrid cancer research data services,The Globus Alliance,Monika Machunik,"Researches use Taverna workbench for creating workflows, which include calls to web services. In case of caGrid data services, the access to the data may be too complicated for the end-users, because of the need to use CQL language. In that case the plug-in will be a great help for biologists, allowing them to focus on their work rather than on correct query construction. Besides the basic functionality of constructing CQL queries, the plug-in will offer additional conveniences for the users."
Developing a Hybrid Honeypot Architecture,The Honeynet Project,Robin B.,"The goal of this project would be to complete the development of a open source Hybrid honeypot framework. This project would be built to facilitate the deployment of honeynet in large networks. Through a Decision Engine and a Redirection Engine that can drop or replay interesting attack sessions in real time, it would provide a scalable solution to help honeypot researchers and network operators to manage their honeynet."
Developing and improving a Web Application Honeypot,The Honeynet Project,glaslos,"Glastopf is a minimalistic web server emulator, written in Python. Glastopf collects web application based attack information like remote file inclusions, SQL-inclusions and local file inclusions. The attack data is stored in a MySQL-database that can be browsed via a web interface. Recently, a very early, stable version of Glastopf was released. The unstable branch has a lot more features, but most of them are lacking some love. I am planning a new stable release within the next weeks."
Further DOM Simulation and other Improvements to PHoneyC,The Honeynet Project,Wang Geng,"We already know that phoneyc is a low interaction client honeypot which is designed for the deobfuscation and detection of malicious content in the wild. But since its framework is quite different from a browser, this limits its ability to do the deobfuscation. In order to do further improvements on PHoneyC, first we must simulate DOM objects in javascript, and then solve other problems of real-time interaction. We wish to focus on these in the GSoC project."
Google summer code application - Honeynet Project,The Honeynet Project,thibaut,"Project 4: Developing a solution for managing client honeypots.I am well suited to perform this project because of my interest in web development and IT security (especially honeypots).I left my country to work on honeypots for one year in the United States, in a specialized laboratory at the university of Maryland, and I am really enjoying it. So I would be very interested in working on this project.I have a lot of time to invest into, and plenty of ideas."
Improving high interaction client honeypots (Capture-HPC and Capture-BAT),The Honeynet Project,Van Lam Le,"This project will do further developments of Capture-HPC and CaptureBAT. These developments include improving data logging and operational management, improving stateful operations, adding network API hooking.Emigrating result data storage from flat file to a suitable database is also covered on this project. "
Improving Picviz to dynamic and visual log data analysis,The Honeynet Project,victor amaducci,"This proposal try to improve the picviz, changing some features and adding new features for it. It addresses some possible improvements in a graphical tool for creating PCP (parallel coordinate plot). Graphics of this type are generally confusing to understand, there are some techniques in studies of PCPs can be applied to optimize the recognition of information in the graphics.Some these techniques will be used in order to turn more easy and efficient analysis of log data using picviz."
Proposal for Project 1: Improving phoneyc,The Honeynet Project,Zhijie Chen,"Nowadays, the web-based malware(AKA:drive-by downloads) has threatened the Internet and web client security seriously. pHoneyC, as a low interactive honeyclient, has done well in the malscript deobfuscation and detection, however, it needs further enhancement. This proposal mainly discuss the main ideas about integrating the phoneyc and libemu library to enable the shellcode detection and emulation, and it also presents a way to collect the downloads downloaded by the shellcode or other scripts."
Qebek: QEMU based Sebek,The Honeynet Project,csong,"Data capture on high interaction honeypot is still of great value, but current de-facto high interaction honeypot monitoring tool Sebek is not good enough, especially for Win32 client. In order to improve its stealthy, stability and data correlation, during the GSoC I intend to implement a VMI-based honeynet monitoring tool, Qebek (aka QEMU based Sebek), for data capture on high interaction honeypots. This tool is based on QEMU and targets at Windows based honeypot. The deliverables include the GPL licensed source code for this functionality, and a working demonstration system running in my lab at Peking University. "
Sebek Time Series Visualization,The Honeynet Project,Kevin G.,"In the security visualization field there are few tools that show data that occur over a series of definite time steps.Most are either graphs with a time axis or a network visualization that views network traffic in real time.This project seeks to create or augment an existing tool to display Sebek data over a series of time steps, at the single instance and network level, to help researchers analyze trends. "
AP mode support for Network Manager ,The Linux Foundation,Witold Sowa,"Since the 2.6.29 version, Linux kernel supports the Access Point mode for mac80211 drivers. However, there is no simple GUI tools available, which would let users set their own AP easily. This project purpose is to add the AP mode support to NetworkManager using hostapd or wpa_supplicant. That will require creating a suitable dbus interface for hostapd or moving hostapd's functionality to wpa_supplicant. GUI tools for managing the Access Point mode will be delivered too."
Common Print Dialog,The Linux Foundation,Alexander Wauck,The goal is to complete the KDE4 implementation of the Common Print Dialog specification (taking into account some anticipated specification changes) and patch applications to support the dialog's D-Bus API.This is a continuation of the work Lars and I did during the previous SoC.
Finalize the common dialog designed by OpenUsability,The Linux Foundation,Per Hermansson,In the OpenPrinting project the goal is to complete the previous implementation of the common printing dialog in at least one toolkit. This involves continuing the effort to be compliance with the dialog specification written by OpenUsability.
IEC 68831-6 support for the new FireWire stack,The Linux Foundation,Mircea,"IEC 68831-6 (AMDTP) is the standardfor most (semi-) professional FireWire audio interfaces. Currently, support in Linux for such devices is provided by the FFADO daemon, which relies on libraw1394 library. This project sets the goal of partly moving into the kernel (as a FireWire driver with an ALSA interface) what FFADO currently implements in userspace.THe impact: huge! It will push Linux even further in becoming a top choice as a music recording and production platform!"
Kevin Seitz's OpenPrinting Application,The Linux Foundation,Kevin Seitz,"I am applying for the OpenPrinting driver management project. I am interested in developing web applications and have gained experience developing them through various projects I have worked on. I expect this project to be a little challenging for myself, but also a valuable learning experience and a way to put my skills to good use."
Make OpenJDK LSB Compliant,The Linux Foundation,Pavel Shved,"Including Java as a mandatory component in the LSB (similar to the support of Perl and Python) has been difficult due to some non-technical issues. I recognize the importance of Java and would like to provide a pathway for Java application to become LSB certified. Therefore, the creation of an LSB certifiable JRE is very important to community and a number of Java application providers. My aim in this project is to patch source code and building scripts of OpenJDK for it to become LSB compliant."
OpenPrinting: Making the web-based application for browsing the database less resource consuming using a PHP/MySQL architecture,The Linux Foundation,Subhankar Sett,"OpenPrinting provides and manages the Foomatic Database which is a central store for printer drivers and is available under the /usr/share/foomatic directory. The current website of OpenPrinting is completely designed based on CGI scripts written in Perl and the various printer & driver configurations are stored in the Foomatic XML format maintained using a BZR VCS on the server.The server faces a lot of hits everyday as people search for the best driver for their printer and this causes a huge overload as CGI processes are created and executed per request generated. The idea is to completely change the architecture of the web-service by layering off things into presentation, service and database levels.The MySQL DB handles all the metadata for each of the printer and driver entries while the service layer polls and inserts data from the DB or from memcached which is an object caching system (http://www.danga.com/memcached). The web page presentation is maintained using smarty templates (http://www.smarty.net) and javascript. Authentication is setup using LDAP to customize access to different parts of the website. Perl and PHP CLI are used to create cron jobs that automate the build of the printer XML DB."

Improving RAIDframe parity handling,The NetBSD Project,Jed Davis,"If a NetBSD system using a software RAID device loses poweror crashes, a lengthy (many hours, for today's disk sizes) andI/O-intensive parity rewrite is required afterwards.I propose tomodify the raid(4) driver to remove this deficiency — which may bediscouraging the use of NetBSD in server applications — by moreclosely tracking which parity information actually needs to berecomputed.In addition, some less major shortcomings of raid(4)could be addressed at the same time."
Miniaturise NetBSD,The NetBSD Project,Lloyd Parkes,"I propose to build a facility to produce a boot image for a system with no more than 4MB Flash / 16MB RAM, run a useful NetBSD router with DHCP client/server, IPv6 route solicitation/advertisement, PPPoE, and an 802.11a/b/g WPA access point. The image will be replicable: using only the NetBSD sources, and my scripts and Makefiles, a developer should be able to cross-build their system boot image."
Minimalistic X Server - NetBSD port,The NetBSD Project,Jeremy Morse,"Currently XOrg supports a minimalistic implementation of an X Server - called ""KDrive"" internally. This provides a set of basic features, and is configured at compile time, resulting in a single binary that doesn't require any config or driver files.This could be highly useful in an embedded environment where an X server is wanted, but space requirements prohibit using a fully featured X server. Currently kdrive only supports Linux, this project is to create a NetBSD port."
PXE Bulk Install,The NetBSD Project,Max Winderbaum,"My objective is to enable a common NetBSD user to configure and execute a bulk install of NetBSD on any number of networked machines using PXE booting.

Finally I will write new documentation for Perl 6, as well as port documentation from others."
Refactoring Catalyst helper modules,The Perl Foundation,Devin Austin,"I will refactor the Catalyst's helpers for extensability. They are underdeveloped compared to other parts of Catalyst. Current solutions are brittle, and inconsistent. I will provide a new API, with tests and documentation. The new API will provide standard methods to initialize and write files, modify existing code, and provide the user with a starting point. This will be a valuable addition, updating the mostly unmaintained codebase and ensuring that helper scripts have improved functionality."
SQL::Translator rewrite,The Perl Foundation,Justin Hunter,"I will rewrite/refactor SQL::Translator. Over time, SQL::Translator has seen the addition of modules from varying developers, leaving an inconsitent API and coding style. The test coverage also leaves something to be desired and makes development difficult. I will implement a consistent API and coding style as well as extend the test suite."

Direct3D - Implement D3DXAssembleShader function,The Wine Project,Mystral,"This project is meant to implement a subset of the API provided by the d3dx*.dll, used by many Windows programs, mainly videogames"
DirectShow/GStreamer Bridge,The Wine Project,Trevor Davenport,GStreamer is an element based multimedia framework very similar to the framework provided by DirectShow.GStreamer could be used to provide support for more media types to Wine's DirectShow without requiring Wine to include support for all that GStreamer supports.
"Implement Texture, Mesh and Font handling in D3DX and get some DirectX SDK samples running in WINE",The Wine Project,Tony,"The first step would be to stub the affected functions. After that I would implement the file loading routings to make it possible to load the most common file formats. Of course there need to be test cases for everything, too.As it's often used in the DirectX SDK samples, it is sensible to implement the ID3DX FontS interface, too. With this groundwork it's a good idea to make about 5-10 samples compileable with WINE-libs and running with WINE. This would prove that our implementation is solid"
Improving JSctipt implementation,The Wine Project,Piotr Caban,Wine has recently added JScript implementation. JavaScript specification contains a lot of builtin APIs that are used by scripts. Most of them are missing in Wine. It's the most common reason why scripts don't work in Wine and I'd like to fix it.
Wine Application Test Suite,The Wine Project,Austin English,"Implement an application test suite for Wine. Wine currently lacks any infrastructure to automatically test any real world applications (currently is a relatively large code based regression test suite, but real world applications still often regress).This will be done by using AutoHotKey (http://www.autohotkey.com) to test windows programs. Scripts will be made to install a program, verify installed files with SHA1SUM, then test running the application, manipulating a file, etc.The test suite can then be used by anyone as part of a nightly build script, by Wine as a precursor to releases, or as a pre-screener to test patches before inclusion."

TP04 Support for tpclient-pywx,Thousand Parsec,Nathan Partlan,"The tp04 protocol, nearing completion, is the next version of Thousand Parsec's server-client network protocol, and it brings with it new features such as dynamic objects and order queues, media attached to objects, and dynamic server and metaserver protocols. However, tpclient-pywx cannot currently take full advantage of these new features, and it is unable to properly work with the new protocol. TP04 support will bring tpclient-pywx in line with the newest developments in Thousand Parsec and keep it relevant and useful. It will also show off the new tp04 features and improve the polish of the interface."
Web client for Thousand Parsec,Thousand Parsec,joelboh,"My proposal is a web client for Thousand Parsec similar to tpclient-pywx but with a web feeling. The web client will be split in two parts, a backend written in python and a frontend written in html, css and javascript."

phpBB and MediaWiki-TikiWiki importer,TikiWiki CMS/Groupware,Rodrigo Sampaio Primo,"I'm a big fan of TikiWiki and I think that a phpBB and MediaWiki importer to Tiki might be a good feature to incentive more people to join the community. My plan is to create an importer interface with native support to phpBB and MediaWiki. The importer should be as generic as possible, so it will be easier to develop support for other softwares in the future. If I'm able to finish the project before the deadline I'm interested in developing the importers from other wiki based softwares to Tiki."
TikiWiki - Workspaces Integration: GUI and Profiles With Data Channels,TikiWiki CMS/Groupware,Aldo BG,"This project deals with the creation of a GUI that enables Workspaces to the front user. Create more Profiles and Data Channels, or improve the current ones, will be a part of this proposal too."

Administration tool for Tux4Kids,Tux4Kids,Michał Świtakowski,"Currently TuxMath and TuxType are standalone programs that are controlled only by the user. The idea is to give more control to the teacher, so that he/she could integrate Tux4Kids into the school curriculum. This includes an ability to set the same activity for all students, manage high scores etc. The project is to create a configuration/administration utility to achieve this goal."
Audio Refactoring and Comment Support for Tux Paint,Tux4Kids,Francisco Tufró,"In this moment Tux Paint is using the SDL_mixer lib to handle sound output. The lack of audio input in SDL prevents Tux Paint adding cool features like recorded audio comments and, in a future networked version of TP, voice chat.The idea is to port Tux Paint audio to Portaudio and libsndfile, two of the most important libraries used to handle sound and sound files.The first one is a portable audio library, which abstracts the platform specific tasks and gives a full I/O audio platform to work with.The second one is I/O library to handle wave files, it supports many different wave formats and frame rates.After porting to these useful tools we can easily add a voice comment facility.Another features like loading custom sounds to use as comments (instead of recording them) could emerge thinking on the possibility of having another sound file libraries like ogg / mp3, etc."
LAN Multiplayer For TUXMATH,Tux4Kids,Akash Gangil," Support for LAN multiplayer mode. This is probably the most ambitious, as it will require  restructuring the game into client and server programs. Networking to be accomplished using  SDL_net. "

I conclude that it is possible to recognize operating systems using only one open TCP port on the target machine. Some improvements related to visualization of large networks in RadialNet are proposed too."
Packet Manipulator: attack framework,Umit Project,Francesco Piccinno,"By adding this features I'm pretty sure that we could extend the user audience. A feature like this is implemented in tools like ettercap but these solutions are limited to static situations.The goal of the project is to provide a general framework to create general attacks, with the help of UmitPlugins infrastructure, XML and schema files and Python language. The project will also include a complete set of common attacks, with point click and pwn semantic."
Umit Quick Scan,Umit Project,Daniel Cassiano,"Sometimes in our jobs, we need to perform some quick tasks and get the results fast with only more relevant information.Thinking about it, the “small version” of Umit idea born to perform tasks quickly.On the Quick Scan, with an easy and intuitive keystroke combination and a simple and fast interface, the users can do their scans with the same time of the command line.Did you think about a network admin tool like the Spotlight of Mac OS X?If not, you can start right now."
UMPA - new features implementation,Umit Project,Bartosz Skowron,"UMPA is a library for packet manipulations. It's being used as a backend for Packet Manipulator GUI. The main feature of the library is to prepare and sending packets over the network.

By the end of the GSoC, the theme editor would be capable of altering theme structure, assigning content location and import/export, and would be easily extendable.Overarching Goals:—Provide a GUI through which anyone (regardless of skill level) can edit Wordpress themes—Allow users to create any layout they choose—Allow content and widgets to be assigned positions and managed visually—Provide automatic cross-browser compatibility"
Adding Photo Grouping by Album Functionality to Wordpress,WordPress,Rudolf Cheuk-Sang Lai,"Wordpress does not support a mass upload of photos, or the manipulation of a group of photos. The ""Photo Grouping by Album"" function will offer three functions. One, users can maintain a list of albums. Each album has a one-to-many relationship with photos in the Media Library. Two, users can upload .zip files and Wordpress will extract and put them into one album. Finally, albums can be added to anywhere in a post using a button, or a markup, and each album also has its individual display page."
Extended WordPress Search Engine,WordPress,Justin Shreve,"Currently the search engine included in WordPress is very limited as to what types or categories of data it can locate and how a blog user can employ the system to locate them (search mode). For example, you cannot search blog posts with a simple strategy such as ""find A string in category C"".It also doesn't support advanced boolean search query formats (grouping, OR, NOT, AND). For these reasons, the WordPress search system needs an overhaul and enhancement..."
Implement and profiling the MPTT technique for store hierarchical data in blogs with a lot categories and pages,WordPress,Diego Caro,"This proposal is about coding and testing of an idea from a WordPress developer. The idea is to implement MPTT (Modified Preorder Tree Traversal) technique, that consists in storing hierarchical data (trees) in relational databases, for get better performance in blogs with a lot pages and categories."
Modified Preorder Tree Traversal,WordPress,Daniel Larkin,"I aim to implement modified preorder tree traversal for quicker sorting and display of hierarchical data in WordPress.Specifically this would help scale WordPress for sites with large numbers of deeply nested pages, categories, and comments."
Theme Framework for Wordpress,WordPress,Micheal Benedict Arul,"Theme Framework for Wordpress will users to create their own themes from the a very friendly UI this project will offer, instead of using a free theme or buying a new theme.Project will have a scratchpad, enabling users to drag-drop elements to it. A CSS Framework will be used to ease the development of themes. HTML and the files will be generated automatically."
Ember: Add better multi threading support,WorldForge,Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo,"Currently Ember works single-threadedly, and there are areas where it could take advantage of multi-threading for performance reasons, and more important, to enhance the player experience by not having momentary freezes (when performing some actions or loading/processing data).The goal is to use multi-threading in Ember, starting by well-defined subsystems (such as network, sound, resource processing...) where independent execution makes sense, and always putting thread-safety first."
Implement a fishing task in WorldForge,WorldForge,Amey Parulekar,"This project aims to implement an interface to allow players to fish in oceans. The aim is not only to implement fishing, but to create certain base features that can then be reused for similar activities in the future.While the basic implementation will have one type of fish and one type of bait, this will be extended to have multiple species of fish, with different behaviours for each species, and different bait for different species, which would introduce the need to select bait carefully."
Implement an art upload/moderation/commit mechanism for WOMBAT,WorldForge,cedric303,"The projet aim to implement a mechanism to allow web-based upload, moderation and repository commits for WOMBAT."
File-System Changes Notification Support,wxWidgets,Bartosz Bekier,"wxWidgets aims to provide developers with a good solution to build cross-platform applications. This includes GUI libraries and a set of companion wrapper libraries for networking, multi threading and more. File system notification support I intend to implement will enable new exciting opportunities for developers using wxWidgets: creating cross-platform indexing solutions, interactive file managers, reloading configuration files in apps, advanced backup and synchronizing software and lots more."
wxAUI Enchancements,wxWidgets,MaNI,"With this project I will fully integrate tabs into the wxAUI interface, Both for drag and drop creation of tabs by users as well as for loading and saving of perspectives.Additionally provided enough time is left over after the primary goal I will integrate proper tested fixes for various other outstanding problems and minor feature enhancements in AUI."
wxWidgets Ribbon-bar component,wxWidgets,Peter Cawley,"The wxWidgets library is currently lacking a ribbon bar component. The ribbon bar has been popularised by programs like Microsoft Office 2007, and there are recurring requests for a wxWidgets implementation. I propose to implement a collection of classes which make it easier for application programmers to implement a ribbon bar in their programs. "
Complete and comprehensive input support for XCB.,X.Org,Mariusz Ceier,"XCB lacks support for X Keyboard (Xkb) and X Input (Xi) extensions.These extensions are not perfect, and there is ongoing work on their successors - Xkb2 and Xi2.The goal for this project, is to, implement XCB binding for Xkb,Xi,Xkb2 and Xi2 extensions."
Input redirection / transformation,X.Org,Joel Bosveld,"Input redirection allows transformation of the input, so that it can match a transformed output. Currently, this is not possible, and input has to be blocked on transformed windows. Currently, input redirection is only available as a set of patches for various x components (by David Reveman). Unfortunately, there are some issues with the patches, as some applications do not behave correctly when transformed. My proposal is to complete the patches, iron out any problems with (potentially broken) applications, and get the patches in a state that can be merged (as it has been waiting for over 2 years, without much happening)."
Reverse engineering of Nvidia TV encoders.,X.Org,Francisco Jerez,"The TV output present on several Nvidia graphics cards lacks support from the nv and nouveau open source device drivers. This forces most users wanting to use their TV out to stick with the proprietary Nvidia software.This project will aim to reverse engineer the operation of the TV encoder integrated on some recent Nvidia chips, and provide a RandR1.3 compliant implementation based on the nouveau driver."
Shatter,X.Org,Corbin Simpson,"Currently, the X server manages one monolithic root pixmap, which each screen uses a portion of for scanout and display. However, this causes many problems related to various hardware limits and memory management.This proposal would implement Adam Jackson's shatter, a proposed technique in which the server creates one root pixmap per screen and manages inter-pixmap rendering through a series of redirections in the rendering pipeline."
Live Test for Openswan,Xelerance Corporation,Daniel Snider,"My task is to improve the LiveTest function of Openswan to help users test their configuration for problems with ISP filters, MTU issues, NAT-T, ipv6, etc. "
Openswan - OSX Cocoa GUI,Xelerance Corporation,Jose Quaresma,"I am doing a Master in Security and Mobile Computing and I am a Mac user that has previously used Linux. I had courses in Human Machine Interface and I have good programming skills in C, Java and C++. Adding to that I am really motivated to work with you, I enjoyed the (small) work I did with you, trying to make Openswan compile in OS X, and I look forward to make this GUI."
Openswan / Xl2tpd plugin for Network Manager ,Xelerance Corporation,Alex Dorokhov,"Create a Network Manager vpn-plugin, which provides easy setup and management Openswan / Xl2tpd network access for users of Linux desktop. Plugin consists of:1) service, which is the bridge between the Openswan / Xl2tpd and dbus-interface of Network Manager. It uses configuration files of Openswan / Xl2tpd.2) auth-dialog, which requests user-authorization when connecting;3) gui, a settings page for nm-applet. Also provides import / export of the settings."
OTRv4 implementation,Xelerance Corporation,Max,"Since I do not have in-depth knowledge of OTR internals yet and I do not want to just copy-paste description from xelerance.com I'll try to make brief description as I understood it so far.The basic idea is to implement OTRv4 feature for creation (and secure transfer) of temporary symmetric cryptographic keys which can be used to securely transmit large amount of date (voice & video streams, file transfer) between OTR clients."
OggPlay enhancements,Xiph.Org Foundation,vigsterkr,"OggPlay library is designed to allow software developers to easily add playback support of various Xiph.Org media formats in their applications. It abstracts away from the complexity of libOgg's encapsulation pages, codec packets, and encoded data, giving the programmer the freedom to work with audio-visual streams, video frames, and audio samples.The student proposes to add the following features to the library: - Dirac support - chained Ogg file support"
Proposal: Making Extension to Record Sound locally and stream to Icecast,Xiph.Org Foundation,Abhinav Chittora,This Project is aimed to create a Firefox extension that can record sound locally and stream to Icecast. In this project I will make the extension platform free.For this extension I will use nsILocalFile interface which will enable the extension to interact with the operating system. I will use operating system's sound recorder to record the sound and then for Windows I have to convert the recorded sound into Ogg vorbis format and then user cam stream it to Icecast.
Implementation of a new medialib backend,XMMS2,Cippo,"XMMS2 is a music player with a media library to keep track of your songs. Currently SQlite is used to store the media info, but this has some drawbacks, most notably in speed. If a specialized backend was used instead of SQlite you could exploit the fact that entries into the medialib share alot of similarities. That way you would get a faster media library and a reduced footprint."
The official awesome client ,XMMS2,Igor Assis,"This is the legendary official client, it's finally time to get it rolling."
Google Gadget and OpenSocial Integration,XWiki,Anamaria Stoica,"Gadgets integration with XWiki will allow users to quickly add any gadget from Google's Gadget Directory to any wiki page or the side panels. Gadgets offer the most diverse functionalities and will benefit many of the unanticipated user needsThe OpenSocial Integration will add a more social dimension to XWiki by hosting OpenSocial apps, thus becoming the first wiki OpenSocial Container. Anyone will be able to install XWiki and instantly create their own social collaborative orientated network."
New XEclipse Navigator,XWiki,Venkatesh Nandakumar,"XEclipse, which itself was initiated as a GSOC project, is a desktop tool that helps in viewing, editing and deleting XWiki pages. GSOC projects have been a major contributor in extending XEclipse.XEclipse has a basic navigator which shows only the pages, objects and spaces in the Server. The GSOC project shall aim to improve this navigator significantly, by adding features like drag&drop, display of attachments/translation, state persistence, better integration with the workbench, and editor"
Skin and template support for XOffice,XWiki,Teofil Achirei,"Project: Skin and template support for XOfficeWhy this project: I use XWord. I would like to extend it. It will raise the standars for both collaborative platforms and editors.Tentative project architecture: 4 components; dealing with CSS optimization, style extraction, VSTO, content controls, XML-RPC."
XWiki integration with OpenOffice,XWiki,Cristina Scheau,"The project is an extension for OpenOffice, which allows users to browse, create and edit wiki documents, or upload and download attachments, all from inside OpenOffice Writer."
