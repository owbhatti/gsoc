Pig - binary comparator for secondary sort,Apache Software Foundation,azaroth,"When Hadoop sorts the keys in the shuffle phase, it will use a binary (raw) comparator, if available. The binary comparator does not deserialize the key into an object and compares directly the byte encoding for better performance.Pig uses the binary comparator when the key is of simple type, but not for tuples. This is important when doing secondary sort, because Pig relies on Hadoop to sort both main and secondary key. Using a binary comparator for tuples will produce a significant speedup."

ZooKeeper Failure Detector Model,Apache Software Foundation,Abmar Barros,"ZooKeeper servers detect the failure of other servers and clients by counting the number of 'ticks' for which it doesn't get a heartbeat from other machines. This is the 'timeout' method and it works very well; however it is possible that it is too aggressive and not easily tuned for some more unusual ZooKeeper installations. This project's goals are to abstract the failure detector to a separate module, to implement several failure detectors and to compare their appropriateness for ZooKeeper."
Zookeeper Read-Only Mode,Apache Software Foundation,Sergey Doroshenko,"When a ZooKeeper server loses contact with over half of the other servers in an ensemble ('loses a quorum'), it stops responding to client requests. For some applications, it would be beneficial if a server still responded to read requests when the quorum is lost, but caused an error condition when a write request was attempted.This project would implement a 'read-only' mode for ZooKeeper servers that allowed read requests to be served as long as the client can contact a server."
ZooKeeper Web-based Administrative Interface ,Apache Software Foundation,Andrei Savu,"I would start by forking the Django Dashboard created by Patrick Hunt, improve the UI and add more features. I want to capture much more information from ZooKeeper by adding hooks, if necessary.

I will use this new grid CustomData type to implement multi-resolution vertex colors and multi-resolution masks for the paint modes.
Proposal for Ptex Integration,Blender Foundation,kwk,"A Ptex file stores multiple textures in multiple resolutions for each face in the model's mesh. With Ptex in Blender artists can paint textures for arbitrary complex models without worrying about UVs. Intrinsic per-face UVs are used to provide a proper texel distribution. Ptex takes care of filtering textures with different resolutions. Since Ptex has been designed for use with subdivision models using Catmull-Clark, the Blender integration needs to be combined with the multires modifier."
Quad Dominant/Full Quadrangulation remeshing tool,Blender Foundation,Rohith B V,"Given an input mesh, the surface is parameterized or a field is generated, and based on either a low-level or high-level method, remeshing is done which closely follows the overall topology of the input mesh, while maintaining good flow. The output mesh is then suitable for catmull-clark subdivision, sculpting, good deformations in animation etc. "

Add metadata and player status information to AVRCP plugin,BlueZ,João Paulo Rechi Vita,"Today the AVRCP plugin in bluetoothd supports only remote control commands. Support for metadata and player status information is missing to fully comply with AVRCP 1.3. This is specially useful for devices with displays, like fancy headsets, cellphones, and car-kits. One of the most illustrative use-case of this feature is a user controlling a media player on his phone via a bluetooth car-kit that shows meta-information about the media beeing played."
Addition of the Message Access Profile to obexd,BlueZ,Milas Bowman,"Message Access Profile permits the sending/receiving of SMS over Bluetooth. A device first initiates a session with a phone. Then, the device can interact with the phone through two services, both implemented as OBEX services. The phone runs a Message Access Service (MAS) server, which presents a virtual hierarchy to the other device. The other device is not only acting as a MAS client but as a Message Notification Service (MNS) server, which listens for incoming notifications of new messages."

The goal is to implement the DUN client as a plugin inside oFono (a linux telephony stack) and if we have time the DUN Server(the Gateway role)."
New command line tool for bluez,BlueZ,Alexander Orlenko,"Now there is no console bluetooth manager, except for a set of scripts in the test/ directory. Sometimes this is not enough, especially if no X server. Many people prefer to perform most operations in the console, even from a full DE.The idea of this project - write the utility to work with bluetooth devices. The main advantage - work in the console! X server is not needed, no binding to the DE/WM."
Bits & Ints Library,Boost C++ Libraries,Murilo Adriano Vasconcelos,"Handling binary data is a very tricky task and is very easy to do mistakes when hard-coding this type of algorithm. Making a library wich helps in manipulating of binary data would be very helpful because it could be used in a widely types of applications sice neither C++ nor Boost have utilities for performing bitwise logical operations on bitstrings. This application proposes a comprehensive set of these algorithms and data structures and intend to be useful, portable and efficient."

"
Making Chromium OS Work Better in More Environments ,Chromium,Todd Deshane,"Users and developers should be able to build and use Chromium OS in as many ways as possible. They should be able to run it in their favorite virtualization platform, boot it with PXE, or boot it as a thin client. The process to do these things should be as easy as possible. This project proposes to add improved virtualization support, make the process of booting over PXE easy, and explore the various technologies that would allow Chromium OS to work in one or more thin client environments."
Porting Pencil through Native Client for Chromium OS,Chromium,rushafi,"The high level difference between a web app and a native app is pretty simple. A web app does its computation in the server where a native app does it in the client machine. A web app uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript for rendering user interface and interacting with user where a native app uses client machines windowing API. The Native Client project targets to pull these two breeds closer and Pencil is a specimen application to show how it can be done."
SSH client for NaCl,Chromium,kate,"NaCl is going to be an extremely important part of Chromium OS. It is absolutely required to have client connectivity options such as SSH, VNC or Remote Desktop on Chromium OS. This proposal aims to fill the easiest part: SSH."

The first one is to integrate the Recast & Detour toolset into CEL, so navigation meshes can be generated automatically from maps. The second objective is to give CEL the ability to efficiently handle pathfinding in large maps, which are divided into smaller sectors connected by portals. This objective is to be achieved using a hierarchical pathfinding algorithm."
New improved hardware augmented culler,Crystal Space,Claudiu,"As Crystal Space relies primarily on software algorithms to do the culling, a new hardware culler would be a good addition to the engine's feature list. As such new, more modern, algorithms, such as CHC++, which take advantage of hardware capabilities offered by new generation graphics chipsets would have to be implemented. A new improved hardware augmented culler will be delivered as the final product of this project, which would boost the rendering performance and strength of Crystal Space."
"Real time hair simulation and rendering, using advanced GPU techniques",Crystal Space,Alexandru - Teodor Voicu ,"For my final university project, I have decided to implement a ""Real-time hair simulation and rendering using GPU"" application. However, after realizing that there is plenty of work to do, that is not strictly related to my application (such as GUI, 3D models, lights, shadows or anti-aliasing), I have decided that integrating my final project into a graphics engine would be a smart idea."
Aptitude Qt,Debian Project,WhE,"Qt GUI for aptitude.

Non-relational database support for the Django ORM,Django Software Foundation,Alex Gaynor,"Non-relational databases tend to support some subset of the operations that aresupported on relational databases, therefore it should be possible to performthese operations on all databases.Some people are of the opinion that weshouldn't bother to support these databases, because they can't perform alloperations, I'm of the opinion that the abstraction is already a little leaky,we may as well exploit this for a common API where possible."
Refactor the app loading implementation,Django Software Foundation,arthurk,"There are currently a few problems with Django's app loading implementation. Most notably, it's not possible to install apps with the same module name and there is no way of specifying configuration options on the app level. The proposed solution will add Application objects to Django, which will hold models and options. To change the models or options, the developer can subclass the Application class."
Create Transformation of Docbook to epub format,DocBook Project,ahorch,"Ebook readers are becoming more than a curiousity, they are becoming a necessity for the traveller and student.Carrying technical materials that start in a electronic format in that same format is more efficient in both space and time.The docbook format is an excellent presentation for documentation. Epub transformation would allow the ease of editing in docbook, and the conveninece of reading in ebook. "

Rich Text Editor Overhaul / WAI-ARIA improvements,Dreamwidth Studios,Elizabeth Baker,"I hate the current RTE, and indeed most of them -- which makes me perfect to find one for Dreamwidth! Because RTEs have bothered me for so long, I wouldn't stop until it was perfect.On the other hand, accessibility is part of my design philosophy, but I've never worked with it on this level before. (What I have done is write semantic code, provide thorough alt text descriptors or genuinely alternative text, and write CSS for screen-readers.) This is a challenge I would love to accept."
Usage and business statistics,Dreamwidth Studios,anarres,"The purpose of this project is to build on the existing statistics system to give detailed usage and business statistics for Dreamwidth, and to create a front-end to display this information graphically using the GD Graph library."
A Memcached Query Cache Plugin for Drizzle,Drizzle,Djellel Eddine Difallah,"Caching is a key ingredient to scale web applications, a simple principle that avoids dbms access if the same query is being executed over and over. The goal of this project is to create a query cache plug-in for Drizzle, that will permit to scale out the memory by storing results of redundant queries in a cache repository like memcached, then return the cached results to clients if the same request is executed, thus without having to parse and execute the query again."
Add a Proper Unit Testing Framework to Drizzle,Drizzle,Paul B," This proposal concerns integrating an unit testing framework with Drizzle and creating unit tests for the main parts of the project.Drizzle uses a regression test suite which allows a fairly good detection of newly introduced bugs. However, it has also its limitations. Most of them could be eliminated with the complementary functionality of an unit testing suite. With the numerous additional benefits it provides, I think it is worth taking the effort of putting the project into practice."

MySQL to Drizzle Syntax Rewriter Plugin,Drizzle,neh,"The aim of this project is to develop a syntax rewriter plugin which can converts MySQL dumps to scripts.A lot of data types and commands have been removed in drizzle to make Drizzle into a lean, mean query-running machine. Drizzle’s aim is to keep focused on MySQL's original goals of ease-of-use, reliability and performance. But these changes make MySQL dumps incompatible with drizzle and create problems to users who want to shift to Drizzle. This project will help them in shifting to drizzle."
Refractor Command-Line Option and Configuration File Processing,Drizzle,Vijay Samuel,"The goal of this project is to remove all of the custom command-line option and configuration file parsing code inside of Drizzle with the boost::program_options library. This will not only cut out a significant portion of source code that is weakly tested, but will replace that code with a well-tested and standardized library of code. "
Replication Plugin for replicating from Drizzle to Memcached,Drizzle,spsneo,Drizzle is a dbms for cloud where scalability is the major concern. Memcached is a caching server between the database and the client which was designed to alleviate the dbms load by caching recently read results from dbms. Inbuilt caching feature is desirable to make Drizzle scalable while helping app developers write less code. The aim of the project is to write a replication plugin which replicates from Drizzle to Memcached maintaining integrity of the dbms while achieving better performance.

Creating a generic Search API,Drupal,Thomas Seidl,"This project is about creating a ""Search API"" module that would complement (and, in some parts, replace) the core Search module and support search module developers by generically implementing tasks and interfaces common to (almost) all search backends. Further services, like a Views integration, could then be built on top of that API, instead of individually for each search backend."
Data Visualization for RDF data,Drupal,Lin Clark,"The inclusion of RDF in Drupal 7 makes Drupal the best mainstream tool for publishing Semantic Web content. However, for people to understand SemWeb, we need to help them use the data produced by Drupal 7 sites. Tools like MS Pivot provide sleek visualizations of data. In this project, I aim to make this kind of data viz open source and easy. With sleek views of linked data, Drupal will not only be the best way to produce SemWeb content, but also the best way to make something of that content."

Optimize the performance of evaluation part of rule sets,Drupal,saubhagya,Rule is an event driven module. According to event if specified conditions of the are met the corresponding actions are taken. Rule sets are sets of rules. Rules of rule sets can be interrelated in their condition part (containing same conditions or their negations). So the same condition generally be evaluated multiple times. This approach is not optimal. We can optimize this by changing the condition evaluation part in the form of a decision tree. Every condition will be evaluated at max one.

Help Gentoo Council and Recruiters by providing web based applications,Gentoo Foundation,Joachim,I would like to make a set of tools that will help Gentoo Council and Gentoo Recruiters Team to work more effectively. I will prepare a website for Council which will do the work that is now done manually and an IRC bot that will allow to use meeting log on website. The Councils website will also allow more input from developers community. The Recruiters website will help recruiters to prepare better quizzes and mark them in more accurately.
Improve NetworkManager integration with Gentoo,Gentoo Foundation,Mu Qiao,"This project will improve NetworkManager integration with Gentoo. NetworkManager is a very popular tool making network configuration much easier which is used in many popular Linux distributions. However, it can’t deal with Gentoo network configuration files which make it quite useless out of the box. This project will make it work properly in Gentoo."
Improve the Octave/Matlab support.,Gentoo Foundation,Rafael Martins,"The Octave-Forge packages can be managed using an internal package manager from Octave, but it is better for Gentoo users to manage the packages with their usual package manager, i.e. Portage, Paludis or Pkgcore. In other words, we need ebuilds for these packages. Thus I created g-octave, which generates fresh ebuilds ""on-the-fly"" from the Octave-Forge packages."
Multiple Repository Support in sys-apps/portage,Gentoo Foundation,Otavio Pontes,"The proposed project is to implement support for multiple repositories in sys-apps/portage. Today, portage handle just one repository of ebuilds, with a lot overlays atached to it. The idea is to change Portage internals to support a stack of ebuilds' repositories. Each repository will be a standalone repository and may have overlays applyed to it. Syncing the repositories and overlays will be done using emerge and repositories will be added in a config file."
"Port the new distro-neutral initrd framework, Dracut, to Gentoo ",Gentoo Foundation,aidecoe,"The project aims to port Dracut to Gentoo. As a first part it will involve fixing test suites and updating modules to work in Gentoo. As a side-effect would be make the Dracut more generic and to ease to port it to other distros. Any changes from there need to go upstream. Second part is Gentoo specific. It will involve creating new (or modifying existing) ebuild for Dracut, integrate it with Genkernel and customize Catalyst (LiveCD generator) to use it."
Portage/ebuild ability to use file-based capabilities rather than setuid ,Gentoo Foundation,Constanze Hausner,"This project will add a feature to Gentoo to use Linux-Capabilities instead of setuid/setgid, which would be a security enhancement. Gentoo allows some security features already and Capabilities will make a useful addition.The user will be able to choose, if he/she wants to use Capabilities by setting a USE-Flag or selecting an appropriate profile."
Porting Portage and its tools to DragonFly BSD.,Gentoo Foundation,naota,"DragonFly BSD is one of *BSD families. It is known for HAMMER which is a file system that provides several new features and rivals ZFS in the future. The idea is to make it possible to use Portage on DragonFly BSD/HAMMER, to create ebuild packages for DragonFly's core system and to make simple desktop work on Gentoo/DragonFly BSD."
Project Grumpy,Gentoo Foundation,Priit Laes,"Project Grumpy is a set of applications for gathering, indexing and interacting with various ebuild- and developer-related metadata."
Revive Kuroo,Gentoo Foundation,Detlev Casanova,"I will revive the currently dead portage GUI Kuroo.It will be ported to Qt 4, and to the new portage API.The goal is to have a Qt based portage GUI again as most of the current onesare GTK+ based. That will give KDE users a better solution when they want agraphical user interface for their gentoo."
Rewrite of g-pypi ebuild conversion tool,Gentoo Foundation,Domen Kožar,"Portage is a complex, full-featured package management for Gentoo Linux distribution. Many languages like Perl provide their own philosophy how Perl package distributions should be handled, for example CPAN. Python provides very similar service, the PyPi website, which can be queried for Python packages and their metadata.g-pypi solves fundamental problems converting pure Python packaged distributions to Portage's ebuilds format with accompanying metadata."
Ventoo - Visual Configure file editor,Gentoo Foundation,Christopher Harvey,"Ventoo is a visual configuration editor that lets the user graphically edit system configuration files. Ventoo was originally written by Luis F. Araujo in '07, but was never finished, as it is a large project. All the existing code is in python and GTK. This summer I'd like to work on Ventoo until it is useable and can be put into portage. I have several ideas that I will outline below that I think would make Ventoo useable by the average gentoo user."
webapp-config rewrite,Gentoo Foundation,Andreas Nüßlein,"webapp-config is the web application installer and updater on gentoo. it currently has many issues and bugs, and its design has some serious flaws. fixing the current mess would be a waste of time. instead it should be reimplemented, possibly in a distro-agnostic manner. (- shamelessly copied from the gentoo wiki, because it says it all, very well)"

Graph Streaming API,Gephi NGO,Andre Panisson,"The goal of this proposal is to set up a framework for graph streaming. A Graph Streaming API would bring a lot of advantages to Gephi, bringing interoperability with other available tools. A high-quality API proposal should be general and, as the Gephi's data structure and visualization engine does, it should be able to deal with dynamic data, with the idea that a graph is not static and might change continuously."
Shader-Based Graph Visualization Engine,Gephi NGO,Antonio Patriarca,"This project aims at the development of a new 3D graph visualization engine for Gephi. The current engine uses legacy OpenGL features to be as portable as possible, whereas the new engine will use the best features to draw as many nodes as possible. It will be based on OpenGL 2.1 (or OpenGL 3.0) using JOGL as Java binding. "
Completing Libgit2,Git,Vicent Marti,"The goal of this application is the completion of several key features which the libgit2 library (a stand-alone git library which is being written from scratch) is currently lacking to interoperate with existing git repositories, namely, the revision walking mechanism and the functionality for index and reference manipulation."
git-remote-svn | Native SVN support in Git,Git,Ramkumar Ramachandra,"The objective of git-remote-svn is to provide native interaction with SVN repositories in Git, the motivation for which comes from the shortcomings of git-svn. I intend to do this by building a remote helper for SVN. Several good SVN exporters already exist, and using one of them with a remote helper should eliminate a lot of the plumbing that git-svn tackles by hand. Also, using a remote helper to interact will provide a simple and natural UI at no additional cost."
Line level history browser,Git,Bo Yang,"This project will add a set of new features to 'git log' command. And these features will allow our users to track change history of any lines of source files. Generally, it provide users with the ability to insight the code in line level."
A more useful Now Playing source for Banshee,GNOME,Alex Launi,"The Now Playing source is an underutilized component of the Banshee user interface. The goal of this proposal is to extend that interface to be a source for extended information about the currently playing media. After the completion of this project, the Now Playing source will replace (or augment) the current behavior of the Context Pane, but also be extended to account for other media types such as podcasts, videos, audio books, and internet radio."
Anjuta Snippets Plug-in,GNOME,Dragoş Dena,"The plug-in will allow easy insertion of code snippets into the Anjuta IDE editor and will have enough options to benefit the easy management of those snippets. By management I mean: easy browsing trough the existing snippets, editing them, importing new ones and exporting them into snippet packages so those snippets can be shared. The snippets themselves will be interactive."
Clutter screensavers,GNOME,William Hua,"The objective is to create cool trendy screensavers based on Clutter, and increase the aesthetic appeal of GNOME to its users, in a way similar to what xscreensaver used to do."
DACP support in Rhythmbox,GNOME,Alexandre Rosenfeld,"This proposal intends to create an open-source implementation of the DACP protocol, aka iPhone/iPod Remote app, as a plugin to the Rhythmbox music player as the ""server"" and a proof-of-concept GObject-based ""client""."
Ease : presentation authoring tool for the GNOME desktop,GNOME,Stéphane,"Currently, there is a lack for a good presentation editor on the GNOME desktop.

GTK+ refactoring to make possible GTK+ 3,GNOME,Javier Jardón,"The idea of GTK+3 is around since 2007 (when GTK+ 2.12 was released). We have GTK+ 2.20 now and seems that there'll be another GTK+ 2.x release.It's time to change this and help to make GTK+3 (finally) possible."
"Improving the desktop experience with the ""Task"" and ""TaskMonitor"" D-Bus API",GNOME,S. Sickert,"The central idea is to export all information related to a running task (e.g. a download, a synchronization, a transcode) and make them available to other applications. This allows various things like the removal of many redundant progress dialogues, the contextual display of progress information and an even more intelligent power management."
Make a Tracker based ORM,GNOME,Adrien BUSTANY,"The idea is to make an ORM to make it dead easy to store, retrieve and update objects from Tracker. Tracker store now being a GNOME module, it's gonna be used by more and more applications. It's therefore very important to ensure it's easy to use. Currently, it can quickly become tedious to update triples in an RDF database. I intend to give a stab at that problem, and hopefully succeed :)"
Proposal for completing Jokosher Telepathy support for recording VoIP calls and extending it with Tubes support ,GNOME,Pēteris Krišjānis,"My name is Peteris Krisjanis, I'm 29 years old IT specialist/student from Latvia, I'm in second year of my CS bachelor’s degree program, and this is proposal for completing Jokosher Telepathy VoIP support, create basic Telepathy Tubes support for Jokosher and high quality sync after recording upon it. "
Rhythmbox: Improved Last.fm Plugin,GNOME,Jamie Nicol,"Last.fm is a fantastic tool for browsing and listening to music, unfortunately Rhythmbox's current Last.fm plugin has an unintuitive user interface.

Cage-based deformation tool,GNU Image Manipulation Program - GIMP,Michael Muré,"Green Coordinates is a method allowing deformation of an image, by deforming the inside of a polyhedral cage. The technique was exposed in Siggraph 2008. Unlike the other classical method (mean value coordinates, harmonic coordinates, ..), it allows high quality deformation by preserving the shape.Basic behavior of the tool:* you ""put"" a closed polygon on the image (not limited to 4 handles)* you deform the cage, the image is deformed accordingly"
HDR and matting operators for GEGL,GNU Image Manipulation Program - GIMP,Danny Robson,"GEGL does not currently contain methods which assist in HDR workflows which have become quite popular. I propose to develop three native GEGL tone-mapping operations.I also propose to target an image matting operator, allowing the straightforward decomposition of an image into foreground and background components. I will implement the `matting laplacian'."
Attach Impress animations to styles,Go OpenOffice,Larisa Raicevic,"Currently there's not an easy way to give the same animation to all the elements of a certain style. Sometimes we just think that all our important titles, besides the big bold Heading1 style, also deserve a big entrance with a swivel, a orange to pink colour change effect, and a boomerang exit. This project would allow for easier, more generic animation adding to our presentation parts."
Improve RTF Export,Go OpenOffice,Miklos Vajna,"The recent rework of OpenOffice’s binary MS Word .doc (WW8) export filter made it easy to extend for other MS Word formats, like DOCX. In particular, using the advantages of the shared code to implement a new RTF export filter based on this rework is certainly possible to implement - and this summer I would like to work on this."
Improvement of OpenOffice Math,Go OpenOffice,Jonas Finnemann Jensen,"This proposal offers some improvements to OpenOffice Math, but focuses on fixing Issue 972, so that equations anchored as characters in Writer will automatically align its baseline with that of the line it is on... So that users need not manually edit this.This proposal offers several additional improvements should the first prove easy to implement, amongst them extra symbols, catalog/ symbol toolbox improvements and intuitive MathType-like input option."
Improving equation editor,Go OpenOffice,Michal Spisiak,"Starmath - Open Office equation editor is in need of significant improvement which could help satisfy expectations of the user. Currently the main issue is baseline miscalculation that causes wrong alignment hence giving bad impression. The aim of this project is to identify the problem, fix it and thus help Open Office to be more acceptable in education, together with solving other issues concerning adding new symbols which could be beneficial and surely welcomed by all users of Starmath."
New Docking Windows and Split View,Go OpenOffice,Thomas Dziedzic,"Many people have requested the split window feature in Writer for a while now.This project's focus would be to create/continue work on new docking windows which would open up a list of new and invaluable features like split views and tabbed windows. A lot of work will be needed in order to complete this first task. This project will then be able to focus on implementing a split view using the new layout manager."
Online Gallery for OOo,Go OpenOffice,tijana,"Currently the Gallery on OOo isn't in its best shape - besides some minor usability flaws, its major disadvantage is that the content is limited to what's shipped with the product. The major part of this project would be to connect the existing gallery to a website (most probably www.opencliparts.org) providing fresh and interesting content, and displaying it within the client application itself. Another part could include fixing some smaller issues with the gallery UI itself."
Google Caja: Popular Library Cajoling,Google Caja,Michael Ficarra,"As a Google Summer of Code participant working on Google Caja, my goal would be to determine what is preventing popular libraries such as MooTools, jQuery, and Prototype from cajoling. Since it seems this task is of a very variable length, I will set my initial goal to determine what is preventing the MooTools core from cajoling, followed by all other classes included with MooTools, and finally (if time permits) moving on to jQuery and others."
"Hierarchy in Meritocracy: Community building and code production in the ASF, EF, and PSF",Google Open Source Programs Office,Oscar Castaneda,"The ASF explains the success of its communities and the software they produce by claiming that meritocratic principles and organizational orientation to software engineering through community building, set them apart from other open source communities. The relevance of these claims, and therefore of institutions like Meritocracy, can be explained and better understood by analyzing them through an organizational model of open source."
Implement automated training missions for OpenHatch.,Google Open Source Programs Office,John Stumpo,"I will add functionality to the OpenHatch website such that users can learn how to use the tools and resources necessary to successfully contribute to open source projects by completing missions involving interaction with, for example, version control systems or bug trackers.Projects could recommend specific missions for prospective contributors to complete to learn the tools and resources the projects use."

This project seeks to further this goal by extending the coverage of the tests and making improvements to the testing infrastructure.
Gstreamer VDPAU support,GStreamer,Carl-Anton Ingmarsson,"Many of todays video cards have built in decoders for a lot of different formats. By adding support for these decoders to Gstreamer, we'll enable playback of HD content on CPU limited hardware where it otherwise would have been impossible. It will also help to unburden the CPU on more powerful hardware so that you for example could compile the Linux kernel while watching your favorite movie."
iXMF,GStreamer,André Dieb Martins,"Interactive XMF (iXMF) is the world's first open interactive audio container format. Designed by the gaming industry, it intends to standardize interoperable interactive audio content. GStreamer currently doesn't support iXMF and having iXMF/XMF support would be a great leap for GStreamer into the gaming market, since it would pioneer a new important standard.This project's main goal is to add iXMF support to GStreamer and making a foundation for XMF-derived format types."

A high performance HTML generation library for Haskell,haskell.org,jaspervdj,"Being a compiled language with a strong static type system, Haskell stands agood chance of surpassing traditional languages used for web applications(php, Python, Ruby) in terms of speed, correctness, and developer productivity.My proposal is to write a high performance HTML generation library using theData.Text library, focusing on correctness, efficiency, composability and easeof use."
Implementing the Immix Garbage Collection Algorithm on GHC,haskell.org,Marco Túlio Gontijo e Silva,"The objective of this project is to implement the Immix garbage collection algorithm onto GHC, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. I believe that Immix is the current state-of-the-art garbage collector described in the literature, and that GHC would greatly benefit from this more modern algorithm. The immediate benefit would be a boost on the performance of native code produced by GHC, as Immix has been shown to deliver gains of 5-to-27% when compared to more traditional garbage collection algorithms."
Improvements to Cabal's test support,haskell.org,Thomas Tuegel,"Currently, package authors must devise ad-hoc solutions to automatically build and run test suites for their software.I propose to improve Cabal's test support by extending the package description file to include information about tests.Cabal will use this information to configure, build and run tests are automatically, making tests more widely used in the Haskell community and improving the quality of software written in Haskell."
Improving Darcs Performance,haskell.org,Adolfo Builes,"The global cache acts as a giant patch pool where Darcs first looks for a patch whengrabbing new patches. This saves time by not downloading the same patch twice from aremote server. It also saves space by storing the patch only once, if you ensure yourcache and your repositories are on the same hardlink-supporting filesystem. Although,being the global cache on the biggest performance enhancing tools, there are issueswhich affect it in certain circumstances negatively."
Improving Darcs' network performance,haskell.org,Alexey Levan,"The goal of this project is to make getting Darcs repositories over network faster. Currently, getting large repositories is unacceptably slow. There are numerous complaints from Darcs users about poor network performance.

Bulletproof Makefile Output Library,Hugin and panotools,Flo,"Hugin uses GNU Make to drive the actual panorama creation process, it creates a makefile from the project settings to invoke the several tools that create the panorama.The current makefile output code is not satisfactory. It will be replaced by a reliable library that encapsulates the output of makefiles and handles all makefile-specific issues, especially quoting. "
Interactive Panorama Overview for Hugin,Hugin and panotools,Darko Makreshanski,Hugin's current fast preview window shows only a preview of the output. The downsides of this is that it's unintuitive for beginners and it constricts every feature to be dependent on the preview of the output. The purpose of this project is to use OpenGL's power for modelling 3D scenes and interactively visualize the intermediate steps of creating a panorama that is the panosphere and the plane in normal and mosaic modes respectively.
Regression tests for libpano13,Hugin and panotools,Tomasz Meger,"This project will add regression tests for libpano13. Current situation: libpano have many responsibilities it is one of the main component of the whole project. Main tasks of the library are: image transformation, optimization.

(French)There is no fast program development without regression tests."
Towards a full patent-free pipeline for panorama stitching,Hugin and panotools,Antoine Dele,"Computer Vision is nowadays broadly studied and form a highly productive area of research, with a lot of various applications. Probably one of the biggest advance in this field was the SIFT descriptor, first introduced by D. Lowe in 1999. Associated to a feature point detector, it's a standard tool for image stitching algorithms. Unfortunately, SIFT is patented in the US. Pablo d'Angelo recently came up with a promising patent-free descriptor, which now needs to be fully integrated in Hugin."

The system will be designed to be extensible to any feature add-on requested in the future."
C++ify the SP layer and make XML nodes private,Inkscape,Abhishek Sharma,"Object Oriented paradigm doesn't need to be justified for its importance and with more modules getting in inkscape and many being deleted, a flexible and efficient way of doing things is required. Hence the importance of C++ifying the codebase, with the first amendable set to be the SP Layer, with focus on privatizing the XML nodes."
Cairo rendering for Inkscape,Inkscape,Krzysztof Kosiński,"Inkscape uses its own rendering library, called libnr, when rendering graphics on the screen and exporting bitmaps. This library is slow, single-threaded and does not have any hardware acceleration.This proposal is about converting Inkscape's rendering subsystem to Cairo. Using the hardware-accelerated cairo-gl backend and OpenCL-based filters will be investigated.

Adding a digital vinyl system (DVS) / external mixer mode to Mixxx.,Mixxx Digital DJ,Bill Good,"Adding an external mixer mode to Mixxx will greatly improve Mixxx's ability to act as a part of a digital vinyl system. Mixxx's current method of achieving this involves diverting one deck to the main output, and the other to the headphone output, allowing the two to be mixed externally. However, no features, such as the equalizer, can be disabled. Benefits of disabling various features include increased CPU time for other threads, and UI recognition of unwanted features."
Effects Units creation based on existing LADSPA integration,Mixxx Digital DJ,Bruno Buccolo,"Playing the right tracks at the right time in a perfect mix isn't enough. Users like to use effects in their mix to squeeze every bit of energy, make creative mixes using filters, delay beats, use reverb. The Effects Units, will have standard controls, so we only map MIDI once, and then plug-in the desired effect to use it. The user will also have the flexibility to choose how he's going to use these 2 effects units, being able to use both on a channel, a unit per channel or even both on master."
Mixxx Sampler Proposal,Mixxx Digital DJ,Ryan Baker,"I am a student at Oregon State University in the Computer Science program. I also DJ locally and on the radio. I feel working on the Mixxx project would be a great experience combining both of these things. I would like to implement a sampler for mix during the GSoC.

"Sphinx Native Language Support: Toolchain for Creating, Tracking, and Viewing Internationalized Versions of Sphinx Documents",Python Software Foundation,Robert Lehmann,"Internationalization and Localization are key in order to reach a broad user base. Python's documentation has historically been maintained in English only. There have been several translation attempts which slowly become obsolete as keeping track of checkins to the reference documentation is a boring and laborious task.Developing a native language support toolchain would make Sphinx a compelling documentation system for open source projects."
Sphinx: Port to Python 3.x and Integration of sphinx.web,Python Software Foundation,Daniel Neuhäuser,"Beginning with the Python documentation Sphinx managed to become the Python documentation generator for python projects, however as of now Sphinx requires Python 2.x to run. Also Sphinx has no support to allow the community of a project to participate in the documentation easily.The aim of this project is to change that by porting Sphinx to Python 3.x and by integrating sphinx.web, last years GSoC project around Sphinx, into Sphinx itself."
Symbolic Quantum Mechanics in SymPy,Python Software Foundation,Matt Curry,"SymPy will benefit greatly by having a complete framework for symbolic quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is a theory that describes the behavior of physical systems at the atomic scale and smaller. The mathematics of quantum mechanics has many aspects of linear algebra built into it, and like any math, calculations can be performed with abstract symbols resulting in intuitive results. By the end of the summer, the base layer for symbolic quantum mechanics in SymPy will be finished."
SymPy:Improving the Symbolic Integrator ,Python Software Foundation,Aaron Meurer,"SymPy, a computer algebra system written and executed in Python, currently has decent heuristic support for symbolic integration.However, the integrator is slow, and being a heuristic, can often fail to find an elementary integral for a function when there is one, even in simple cases.I plan to improve SymPy’s integrator by improving the heuristics as well as implementing some of the Risch algorithm, which will guarantee elementary results if they exist."

Mailman Authentication using MM data,Systers: Women in Computing,Jaideep Khandelwal,"The idea basically aims keeping in mind about Mailman 3.0 and that could be used as a plugin and compatible with the different kind of frame works to be used with it.Basically here will be to create a Open ID system something similar to how Google accounts are managed and with the single sign on , one can access the Google products.Use of Redundant Open ID only to restrict for systers site."
Mailocate - Implementing Archive Search Capabilities in Mailman,Systers: Women in Computing,beachbrake,"Mailman archiving is quite rudimentary and searching is non existent. People have to rely on Google or other mail archival sites. In this project I will attempt to add search features by implementing a searching and indexing engine. I will also make a proof of concept search feature in mailman allowing users to try out the framework. More front end improvements can be made later on. Finally, a script will be made to index already existing archives."
"Patches, Release and Testing Automation for Systers-Mailman",Systers: Women in Computing,vidayer ,"The existing Systers code is a branch rather than in patch form, making it hard to test on various Operating systems like Debian, Fedora, and even between two releases of Ubuntu8.04 and Ubuntu9.10 it will be harder to test and debug. This proposal aims to introduce automation into the development cycle so that new releases are compatible with upstream development cycles. The BZR Launchpad CVS has a very nice system of PPA which can be utilized for release control and documentation too."
Proposal for Improved Display of and Statistics on Archives,Systers: Women in Computing,Yian Shang,"I'd like to work on enhancing Mailman's archives, or more specifically, on generating member statistics, info, and visualizations of such with Google Charts and/or SVG. I'd also like to focus on building a better display for the Mailman Archives, with all messages within a thread being aggregated on a single page. There will be options for flat/nested modes as well as collapsing of messages."
 A Publish/Subscribe Style Decentralized Introduction ,Tahoe-LAFS,Md Omar Faruque Sarker,"Decentralized introduction can effectively distribute the task of introducing new nodes and thus Tahoe-LAFS can get rid of the problem of single-point of load and single-point failure (Issue #68). Here we propose to implementa publish/subscribe style algorithm that can enable multiple introducers to share the load of introduction tasks in a decentralized way.Scalability analysis,verification through simulation/experimentation and performance testing is also included here."
Cloud App - Music Player,Tahoe-LAFS,Josip Lisec,Tahoe-LAFS is a perfect platform for distributing web applications which are highly dependant on user's data and require no server-side capabilities. I plan to write a fully featured music player which embraces the social components of the web while retaining privacy and security provided by Tahoe-LAFS. This application should be just a glimpse of what can be built on top of Tahoe-LAFS: highly interactive applications providing alternative views to files stored in Tahoe-LAFS.
DVCS integration with tahoe-lafs,Tahoe-LAFS,Yu Xue,"Tahoe-lafs is a secure distributed file system which have unique security and capability access control property.By using security means such as cryptography,erasure coding,least-authority, it can provide security protection such as confidentiality,integrity and fault-tolerance. In this project we plan to integrate some popular DVCS such as mercurial,git and darcs with tahoe-lafs.The integrated-DVCS can read/write storage grid directly and use the unique features which tahoe-lafs provides.

MSNP2P is the protocol used for P2P data transfers, taking care of webcam, file transfers etc. The current implementation is complicated, with code scattered in different files or including several functionalities in the same proc.If time permits, MSNP2Pv2, which has been RE-ed and takes into account Multiple Points of Presence, will be implemented as well."
OpenACS Abstraction Layer ,Tcl/Tk Community,Eduardo Santos,"OpenACS is a robust web development framework, and It’s already in production in a lot of environments, such as government agencies and organizations, universities, NGO’s and companies around the world. However, its concept design was completely based on AOLServer. The project idea is to rewrite the server integration using the Wub technology layer and to make OpenACS a more portable framework."
OpenStreetMap package and editor in Tcl/Tk,Tcl/Tk Community,Andrew O. Shadoura,"The first part is a package(s) for handling OpenStreetMap data in convenient form, which will automatically translate between internal and XML forms, communicate with server, and give easy access to all objects. Also, it needs to have some abstraction to give ability to manipulate virtual ways (segments).The second part is an OpenStreetMap editor in Tk, utilizing the package(s) from the first part, and the segmented approach."
SCORM Compliant Run-Time Environment for OpenACS,Tcl/Tk Community,Michael Aram,"This is a follow-up project to last year's successful SCORM project, which focused on input/export and presentation of SCORM packages. During the last project, it turned out that implementing the runtime environment (RTE) is a relatively big task. Thus, currently, the RTE implements only the most basic RTE-API functions and is therefore only capable of importing simple packages. A standard conformant RTE is still a precondition for using the outcome of the former project in real-world scenarios."
Tcl state machine back-end module for XMLVM,Tcl/Tk Community,Ozgur D Ugurlu,A stack based interpreter implementation in Tcl. Working as a back-end for the XMLVM bytecode cross-compiler. This would all JVM bytecode producing languages and .Net languages to be translated to Tcl. 
Themed Tk on Unix,Tcl/Tk Community,Ewa Leszczyńska,"Tk Widget Styling Support is a really old topic. First mention I found is http://www.tcl.tk/cgi-bin/tct/tip/48 with date of 23 July 2001, and I want to finish it now. I often have that urge to change the look of applications. But I know that theming is not just to make eye candys. This topic is generally about rewriting the code from Motif-looking widgets to use Qt or GTK instead. That way system layouts can have an effect on Tk programs."
Complete the ast_storage project for voicemail,The Asterisk Project,John Khvatov,"The project aims at creating a storage engine with several backends for use in asterisk applications. This engine will allow to write a storage independent code in an application, select a storage backend type at run-time (optionally per-user), add new storage backend without modifying the core application code. Also, as a part of the project, it is planned to rewrite app_voicemail with ast_storage engine."

Integration of Sonar in IDE to enable instant feedback to developer,The Codehaus,Evgeny Mandrikov,"Sonar is web platform which can be used by all stakeholders, whatever they are manager, team leader, developer, qa analyst, ... The main benefit of the platform is to ease the communication between all those stakeholders when times come to talk about source code quality. But it's a bit cumbersome for a developer to use Sonar during his daily work as it's not integrated into his IDE. The Sonar IDEproject should offer a full integration into the IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ Idea, ...)."
Nicer DSLs in Groovy with GEP-3 ,The Codehaus,Lidia,"Domain-Specific Languages are easy to implement with Groovy, which offers various techniques and approaches for that purpose. We have discussed a Groovy Extension Proposal (GEP-3) for extending Groovy's ""command expression"" syntax to make for even nicer and more language natural like Domain-Specific Languages. The purpose of this project is to try to implement this proposal, learning along the way about the internals of Groovy, the Antlr parser, dynamic languages, and DSLs. "

DNS-SD based wide-area ECF discovery provider,The Eclipse Foundation ,Markus Alexander Kuppe,"ECF has been supporting multicast based discovery for a while now allowing for zero configuration remote services. However, multicast discovery is limited to the local subnet only. Thus it's time to bring discovery to wide area networks (WAN) by implementing functionality for DNS-SD based discovery which will enable a complete new range of use cases."
Google Wave ECF provider,The Eclipse Foundation ,Sebastian Schmidt,"Google Wave is a real-time collaboration system based upon operational transformation approach to replicated state synchronization. With the Cola System, ECF has been using operational transformation, for some time now. I propose to implement a provider to allow an equinox+ecf based web server to inter-operate with Google Wave. Like I read in Bugzilla there are many people who would like to have this feature implemented. The provider is also part of the official ECF project-plan / roadmap."

Improve Eclipse Git integration,The Eclipse Foundation ,Dariusz Łuksza,"Git is a great distributed revision control system and, thanks to EGit and JGit developers, Eclipse has quite high quality support for Git right now. The goal of this project is to improve EGit functionality by integrating it with ""Synchronize view"" (which is one of the best features in Eclipse CVS plugin). The second part of the project would be adding 'git stash' support for JGit and UI for it into EGit. Implementing both these features would make Git support in Eclipse closer to 'CVS quality'"
index based model compare match engine,The Eclipse Foundation ,sleopold,Model elements matching is the most critical phase during model comparison regarding performance and memory consumption. Further improvement of the current EMF Compare GenericMatchEngine and the adoption and integration of new ideas and concepts in this part of the EMF Compare framework can largely help to get better scalability.
WAR deployment for RAP/Equinox based applications,The Eclipse Foundation ,hstaudacher,"When searching the RAP newsgroup for ""WAR deployment"" 210 threads appear. The reason for this is that many developers have problems deploying a RAP application. These problems exist because RAP products build on top of Server-Side Equinox. Equinox has special requirements for the deployable archive. To making things easier for beginners and to simplify the deployment process a good approach and tooling is needed. The goal of this GSoC 2010 project is to provide this approach and tooling."
Audit Kernel Events,The FreeBSD Project,Efstratios Karatzas,Kernel subsytems such as NFS & PF can be enhanced to log security related information using TrustedBSD's Audit subsystem. The kernel audit framework will need serious reworking itself because it is currently based on the notion that information is gathered only through system calls and a single kernel thread will be involved in at most one security event at a time. This project will focus in providing audit support for NFS RPCs and the necessary foundations for modifying other kernel subsystems.
BSD-licensed Text-Processing Tools,The FreeBSD Project,Ben Fiedler,"I will write or complete BSD-licensed replacements for the tools man, diff, sdiff, and sort.The rewrite of man will be necessarily be accompanied by integrating the FreeBSD mdocml port into the system base and configuring it as a replacement for the entire groff suite of tools."
BSNMP enhancement: A new module,The FreeBSD Project,uzunchev.stanislav,The aim of this project is creating a module for the BSNMP framework. The module should be able to monitor jails and log information.
Collective limits on set of processes (a.k.a. jobs),The FreeBSD Project,Gábor Kövesdán,"The SGI Irix operating system introduces the concept of jobs, which are set of processes handled as a unit. The Irix API provides system calls to set collective resource limits on jobs, which are then enforced by jobs-aware schedulers.This application proposes the implementation of kernel-level and userland support with an Irix-compatible interface for better portability. The efficiency of the implementation is considered a crucial point of this project."
Complete libpkg and create new pkg tools,The FreeBSD Project,David Forsythe,"The goal of this project is to complete libpkg (created during GSoC 2009) and build a stable set of pkg tools with it.This includes adding any features to libpkg that are needed by the FreeBSD pkg tools and are not present in the library, adding testing to libpkg, and creating any pkg tools that could benefit from libpkg.Additionally, this project will try and keep track of the revisions to pkg_install being made by others, and changes made to the standards of packages on FreeBSD."
Complete Package support in the pkg_install tools and cleanup,The FreeBSD Project,Julien Laffaye,"The purpose of this project is to add complete package support in the pkg_tools and in the ports tree. A complete package is a package which includes all the required dependencies in its tarball.Unlike the PBI package format of PC-BSD, once a complete package is installed, it appears as every package contained in the complete package was installed separately.To achieve this goal, use of libarchive in the pkg_tools is planned. Refactoring will also be done to improve code reusability."
Distributed audit / log shipping daemon,The FreeBSD Project,Sergio Ligregni,"The shipping daemon will deliver the audit trails generated through the network to a master system, that will admin the trails to have the auditing centralized, ease to admin and practical. The admin will have all the trails in one system and can do the security auditing in one system (perhaps a special system to keep the auditing). Some mechanisms as MD5 checksum and cryptographic features will be implemented to guarantee the integrity of the delivery system."
Enhance FreeBSD ext2fs to support preallocation and update ext2fs to able to read ext4 file systems,The FreeBSD Project,gnehzuil,"This project implement preallocation in ext2fs and update ext2fs to be able to read ext4 file systems and possibly add other functionality, such as write ext4 file systems."
File system changes notification,The FreeBSD Project,iputsikau,"Most of the applications in FreeBSD currently use polling because of limitations of kevent-based file change monitoring (gamin, kde). Kevent approach has the same limitation as Linux' dnotify once had: file or directory should be opened to monitor changes, preventing file system unmounting. I propose to develop a kernel level file system changes notification mechanism for FreeBSD overcoming this limitation."
FreeBSD project in GSoC,The FreeBSD Project,Mohammed Farrag," FreeBSD Project , Reduced FreeBSD kernel size for embedded, mentor is Warner Losh,sent by Mohammed Farrag,Developing new kernel structure for embedded."
Generic DMA engine framework for FreeBSD,The FreeBSD Project,Jakub Klama,"The aim of this project is to provide a generic, flexible frameworkfor initiating and controlling DMA transfers using General PurposeDMA engines, found in most of embedded SoCs - along with tests anddocumentation. There are analogous frameworks for NetBSD (dmover(4))and Solaris (ddi_dmae(9F)), but they are not well suited for embeddedtargets and don't offer all required features."
Make optional kernel subsystems register themselves via sysctl,The FreeBSD Project,Ilya Bakulin,"The goal of this project is to provide an easy way of registration of optional kernel components under the kern.features sysctl tree, and spoofing of these values. This will help porters to improve automatic build configuration of ported software. Also writing system administration tools would become easier."
Namecache improvements,The FreeBSD Project,Gleb Kurtsov,"Reliable full path resolution for opened files and directories is becoming expectation from more and more software. Unlike Linux, VFS in FreeBSD is inode-centric and thus full path resolution is hard. Namecache in FreeBSD tends to reclaim intermediate directory vnodes and purges all entries from cache on removing or renaming single entry in directory, making full path resolution even harder. I propose to develop a directory cache that would make reliable full path resolution possible."
New experimental infrastructure for stable packages and binary updates,The FreeBSD Project,ivoras,"This proposal aims to offer at least an experimental implementation of both, in a way that offers user a subset of available ports (from the ports tree) in an ABI-stable way which will also be maintained for at least the period of 12 months from the SoC project start, together with their binary packages and a rsync-like distribution method for both. The proposed technologies for building this infrastructure include reliance on existing FreeBSD tools and libraries, with Lua as the glue language."
Port FreeBSD to Yeeloong,The FreeBSD Project,phcoder,"Yeloong, also known as ""rms laptop"" is a Chinese-designed netbook based on Loongson 2F CPU. It's popular among Free Software enthusiasts and people who want a small yet powerful netbook and don't care about windows being available. FreeBSD could profit much from thismips relaunch. When this port is done porting to other Loongson-based device should be relatively easy."
Ringmap Capturing Stack for High Performance Packet Capturing in FreeBSD,The FreeBSD Project,Alexander Fiveg,The ringmap project has drawn a lot of interest from several research groups. I would like to continue my work on this project in order to improve and extend the developed software for production use in the open source community. I also would like to establish contacts to other software developers and use the opportunity to take part in GSoC for further development of ringmap.

The service will be developed in an extensible manner which will allow to use any transfer service, and will provide a concrete example with GridFTP as the transfer service."
A Spot Instances Approach for Scientific Clouds,The Globus Alliance,pauloricardomg,"In many environments, cloud resources spend much time unoccupied due to a low demand on the cloud infrastructure. One way to maximize the utilization of the cloud infrastructure is to allow clients to bid on unused cloud capacity, and thus obtaining lower allocation costs.This project's goal is to extend the Nimbus Workspace Service to allow clients to bid and allocate cloud resources in an Amazon EC2 Spot Instance's fashion, targeted for science needs."
"Application to ""Annotation Generation and Analysis Supporting Services-Oriented Scientific Workflow Discovery and Composition""",The Globus Alliance,M. Benson,"Web services allow scientists to reuse existing applications to save time in creating scientific workflows. The process of selecting a web service to use can be a time consuming and difficult one. There is room for improvement by providing web services with annotations, or information about the service and its performance. Annotations could be added and analyzed by an automated program, which could also make recommendations for scientists on which services to use for their scientific workflows."
"Making the Swift Parallel Scripting System Easy to Install, Evaluate and Learn on Readily Available Computing Resources",The Globus Alliance,David Kelly,"Swift is an extremely useful scripting system for leveraging the power of parallel computing. Recently, I have had the experience of going through the installation process, setup, and wading through user documentation as a new user.

Profiling the new GridFTP server,The Globus Alliance,Huong Luu,"The goal of this project is to do a full system profile of Globus GridFTP server including CPU and memory profiling. From the system profiling information, I will learn to understand the tradeoff between single client performance and server load and the impact of several parameters on data transfer rate and server CPU utilization. I will identify such configurations that improve the client performance without increasing server load and enable users to configure and optimize their systems."
Storage system support for Swift,The Globus Alliance,Thiago Silva,"Swift is a parallel scripting system for computing at petascale level. Building a system at this scale is not an easy task. The particular case of data management is handled using collective data management and data-aware dispatching. However, there is still space for improvement. We propose to use a shared file system deployed across all storage nodes and enable the application to pass hints about its data usage patterns. These hints are used by the storage layer to optimize its operations."
Unix Domain Sockets for XIO as transport driver.,The Globus Alliance,Vivek Malik,"To implement Unix domain sockets as an XIO transport driver, which will be used to coordinate the submission of jobs via a single job manager process in GRAM5.

"Visualizing and summarising high volume, wide-area data movement with statistical methods and association rules.",The Globus Alliance,Sami,"A graphical application for processing data and generating visualizations and summary statistics from data transfer records. The application would be used to create and edit report schemas that define what statistics and visualizations are generated from the data. The aim is not to replicate data mining and visualization software implemented elsewhere, but to leverage them through plugins and to produce a simple UI for visualizing data mining results and generating reports."
XIO Reliable Multicast application,The Globus Alliance,Björn Andersson,"The project aims to implement a type of multicast similar to Reliable Blast UDP. The idea is to achieve as high reliability as TCP, with less overhead. Another part is to test reliability and performance of the solution.The main deliverable will be the source code for the driver. Other deliverables are a performance/reliability study and a user guide. The reliability tests will simulate lost packages. The performance study will compare the driver to round robin file transfers and udpcast."
*LibreDWG* Write support for the DWG format,The GNU Project,Anderson,"I will work on the write support for the dwg format in the LibreDWG project. Since the reading of the format is almost entirely implemented, the writing has become a priority. With that in mind I intend to create the file structure with the readers and features necessary. The objects, entities and most part of data structures are already implemented, so this work aims to glue all together and create the files according to each version specification. "
Application for GNU Denemo,The GNU Project,Nils Hammerfest,"My Name is Nils Gey and I want to help out GNU Denemo during the GSoC.I am a student of Music at the Music University of Cologne, Germany and I am a programmer as well.The Denemo Idea to add MusicXML Import (and probably more formats) is the right thing for me. I fit perfectly in the description listed here http://denemo.org/index.php/Summer_Of_Code_2010 ."
GNOWSYS emacs web services,The GNU Project,Divya,"Idea is to develop an emacs like editor with the org specific semantics for the purpose of note taking & authoring. Applying the rules of Org notations, it can also be extended to incorporate gnowsys-mode as it currently works in emacs. Export like features of Org-mode will be made possible in this editor by communicating through local emacs server. All the gnowsys-mode specific commands will pass on the request to the GNOWSYS server via local emacs daemon."
GNUstep Graphics Backend Improvement,The GNU Project,Eric Wasylishen,"GNUstep has had a modular graphics backend system (GNUstep-back) for many years, supporting several vector graphics libraries on X11 and Windows, and an API inspired by Display PostScript. However, GNUstep's relative Cocoa uses an API called CoreGraphics which is a better fit for modern graphics hardware.My project is to modernize GNUstep-back, first by finishing the Opal library (a subproject of GNUstep implementing the CoreGraphics API.) Secondly, I will refactor GNUstep-back to use Opal."
GNUstep: D-Bus bindings for gnustep-base.,The GNU Project,Niels Grewe,"The scope of this project is to implement support for the D-Bus IPC mechanism in the gnustep-base library. GNUstep already has a powerful IPC mechanism called ""Distributed Objects"", but supporting D-Bus as well has additional benefits: By providing a similar API for both DO and D-Bus, GNUstep applications can transparently access existing D-Bus services (such as HAL) or expose their own functionality to non-GNUstep applications, therefore integrating more seamlessly into a user's desktop."
GUILE Lua Implementation,The GNU Project,theseaisinhere,"An implementation of the Lua 5.1 programming language for GNU Guile, using the new language and compilation infrastructure."
Guile PEG Parser,The GNU Project,Michael Lucy,"I would write a module for Guile that will compile Parsing ExpressionGrammars (PEGs) into VM instructions, using macros at syntax-expansiontime or a procedural layer according to the user's tastes.This wouldbe used both for both parsing and matching text."

Revive and Restructure the Escher project,The GNU Project,Marcos Roriz,"Escher is an implementation of the client side of the X11 protocol written completely in Java and is the library behind XPeer code in GNU Classpath. XPeer is an implementation of the AWT Toolkit based on Escher. The proposal objectives are to revive the project and sync with GNU Classpath, fix and refactor some parts of the API, and lastly start decoupling X11 specific code from the rest of the API, to allow other backends like the proper Java X11 code, OpenGL or DirectFB."
Revive Prolog for Java,The GNU Project,Daniel Thomas,"The GNU Prolog for Java project made its last release on 2000-11-12. There is significant work still to do on it firstly it should compile with a modern compiler (something newer than Java 1.2), secondly it should support part 2 of the ISO standard (modules). It should also have testing extended to ensure it conforms to the ISO standard. There are various other parts of Prolog that are implemented in most compilers. A polished up version should then be released and packaged up."
Tuning the VM Subsystem in GNU/Hurd,The GNU Project,Karim Allah Ahmed,"The goal of this project is to bring the virtual memory management in Hurd/Mach closer to that of modern mainstream kernels (Linux, FreeBSD and xnu), by comparing the implementation to other systems, implementing any worthwhile improvements, and general optimization/tuning."

Improving PHoneyC----Detecting and Analyzing Malicious PDF attack,The Honeynet Project,zhanghuilin,"Nowadays malicious PDF is a serious Internet security threaten, and its detection and analysis becomes a quite hot research topic. PHoneyC, as a low interactive client-side honeypot, has done well in analyzing malicious HTML pages and also has a module to handle with PDF files, however, this module is not strong enough to analyze complex malicious PDF attack. This proposal discusses the idea to deal with four kinds of malicious PDF attack."
Log Anonymization Library,The Honeynet Project,Gabriel Cavalcante,"The sharing of real logs and network data is very important for researchers, educators and analysts. Many log anonymization tools and techniques have been created. At the same time many atacks was created, trying to exploit weaknesses in this process. This proposal aims new techniques for anonymization proccess and attacks prevention modules. In addition, the possibility of two or more sources of data as input, to make an coherently anonymized set of logs, wich is not present in neither tool."
Log File Anonymization,The Honeynet Project,Guillaume Touron,"This project aims at developing an API providing services for log file anonymization through a C library. Indeed, sharing logs is one of the main ideas of Honeynet Project, but this could involve leakage of sensitive data that their owners would not want to expose to the public for security reasons. In order to reach this goal, this API must be able to find out sensitive data from several types of logs and hide them while preserving the meaning of logs."
My proposal for infected host detection through DNS analysis,The Honeynet Project,Swen Yang,"In this proposal, I demonstrate my specified ideas on how to detect infected hosts through DNS analysis, including using a bad domains list, IP reputation records, infected hosts list etc. The goal is to build up an efficient and accurate detection mechanism."
PHP/RFI Sandbox,The Honeynet Project,Rostislav Skudnov,I suggest creating a sandbox for PHP scripts used by attackers. It will use and extensions to PHP like 'funcall' and 'APD' to create callbacks for functions related to network and filesystem access. Those callbacks will capture all network traffic and changes to files initiated in a given PHP script. Features like chroot() and SuExec will be used to isolate that malicious script from the system. I've made a prototype can be found here: http://dimensio.dc.turkuamk.fi/sandbox/sandboxindex.php
Project 1 - Improve our low interaction client honeypot PHoneyC,The Honeynet Project,njain,"I propose to design an anomaly detection engine by wrapping the c++ library for anomaly detection system, libAnomaly in cython. This engine can then be utilized from phoneyC to detect unknown attacks with high degree of confidence and low false positive rate. Thus a lot of interesting things can be done like detecting previously unknown attacks, deobfuscated JS code, characterize exploit, generate exploit signature etc."
Project 13 - Infected host detection through DNS analysis,The Honeynet Project,mkr,"Project relate DNS analysis, implementation of algorithm and data structures, detection of various types of anomalies that can happen while looking on dns traffic. "
Using hardware virtualization to improve high interaction honeypot data capture system,The Honeynet Project,csong,"During this year's GSoC I intend to implement a new HI honeynet data capture tool, HV-Sebek (hardware virtualization assisted Sebek). This tool will have all the capability Sebek does now but will be much more stealthy and better tamper-resistance. This tool will be based on MAVMM and target at monitoring Linux based honeypots. The deliverables include the GPL licensed source code for this functionality, and a working demonstration system running in my lab at Peking University."
VoIP (SIP) Honeypot Implementation in Dionaea,The Honeynet Project,Tobias W,If one follows the news and blog posts about VoIP security it becomes apparent that attacks on VoIP systems are getting more popular among malicious hackers and criminals. Dionaea is a low-interaction honeypot that exposes known vulnerabilities to the network. Once an attacker attempts to exploit these software flaws Dionaea tries to capture the malware from the network. My project will improve and extend Dionaea with a module that allows to detect and capture common VoIP attacks.

It will focus on expressiveness of relevant properties, as well as analysis capabilities."
Checking Java Annotation,The Java Pathfinder Team,frogaczewski,"Imagine the world where computer systems are handling all critical situations. It is required that those systems are tested by powerful verification tools. In order to maximize application reliability, production version should not differ from testing version. Achievement of that is possible using annotations which are detected on runtime. Aim of Checking Java Annotation project is to develop set of annotations that can be applied to Java programs to assist tools that detect software defects."
Construction of Linear Temporal Property verification extension,The Java Pathfinder Team,Phuc Nguyen Dinh,"JPF can verify various temporal properties, yet it hasn’t supported of generic temporal property verification (LTL or CTL). Presently,LTL-translator extension has implemented; however, Buechis received are quite generic, so there haven’t been any extension to check them. Thus, user must implement a corresponding listener to each property they want to verify. Hence, I propose a JPF extension that furnishes generic support for LTL and provide simpler way of concrete temporal property verification."
Coverage Visualization,The Java Pathfinder Team,yoonki,"This project involves developing new techniques for visualizing the residual coverage, the source-code portions that are not yet covered, in JPF. Visualization helps JPF users by assisting users in navigating both code under test and test code, thereby assisting users to understand and infer reasons of why certain code portions are not covered. This project will be implemented as an Eclipse plug-in by using Eclipse Visualization Toolkit including SWT, GEF, and Zest."
Customizable Trace Server,The Java Pathfinder Team,Igor Andjelkovic,"The trace server contains a database and two front ends, one for storing and one for querying data. During the execution of the SUT by JPF, a trace emitter captures events from JPF listener, add them some property values, and stores then using the trace storer interface. On the analysis side, a trace analyzer queries the database by using the trace query interface, generating a number of reports as a result. Report generation will allow events generated by extensions to be included in the trace."
Extending String analysis in Symbolic Java Pathfinder,The Java Pathfinder Team,Gideon Redelinghuys,Extend the symbolic execution to allow efficient string analysis of all Java string operations.The implementation should support both automata-based decision procedures for strings as well as bit-vector based approaches. For the former the Java String Analyzer (JSA) system can be used and for the latter HAMPI. The project should include a detailed comparison of these two approaches.
LTL verification in JPF,The Java Pathfinder Team,Ewgenij Starostin,"I propose an extension of Java Pathfinder (JPF) to verify a system under test (SUT) against linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae.This work will implement the double DFS algorithm to search the state space of the SUT, computed by JPF, and the Büchi automaton provided by the existing LTL2Buchi code, for violations of an LTL specification.Additionally, this work will provide the means to annotate Java code with LTL formulae in the style of the existing work in the jpf-aprop project."
The JPF Inspector,The Java Pathfinder Team,Pavel Jancik,"How many times during debugging do you want to make a step back and examine changes again?Error trace analysis is an evil, isn't it? What about a nice GUI, where you can single-step error trace and observe program state and variables?Does your environment test all possible branches? Are you interested in the code coverage of tested system?My Inspector tool will solve your problems."
Annotation support for API Sanity Autotest,The Linux Foundation,nem,The goal of this project is to add support for annotations to the API Sanity Autotest.

This should allow to significantly improve quality of the generated tests.
Compression of locally installed PPD repositories,The Linux Foundation,Vítor Baptista,"Every PostScript printer needs a PPD file to work. With hundreds (and more) of supported printers, there're many files. In a typical Ubuntu installation, they count for about 60 MB of space. This is almost 10% of the capacity of a CD, the usual GNU/Linux distribution's media of choice. As more printers are made every year, there is a growing need to find a way to compress these files. This proposal explains my solution."
Cross Distribution Package Dependency Translation,The Linux Foundation,Evgeny Chernov,The project aims to create tools for developers and users that can help to distribute software to different Linux systems and to install 'alien' packages (created for other Linux system) on particular system. These tools should work over the web service that provides information about names of dependences on different Linux systems.

While servers with 64 or more cores are becoming common in future, the prices of DRAM remain prohibitive. Considering these trends, memory compression appears to be an effective way of utilizing memory resource which is often the main bottleneck for Virtualization workloads."
NetworkManager: fast-user-switching support and related goodness,The Linux Foundation,Daniel Gnoutcheff,"There are a number of problems with how user-specific network settings are handled by NetworkManager. For example, the current approach does not work with fast-user-switching, and it's difficult for applications modify user-specific network settings data without being responsible for *all* of the settings data. This project would address these problems."
Upstream Tracker,The Linux Foundation,Andrey Tsyvarev,"This project aims on creating an extension for Upstream Tracker tool including scheduling main activities (installing library versions, API testing, ABI tracking, checking for new versions), sending e-mail notifications with daily run results to all interested parties (e.g., upstream developers or distribution maintainers) and other features."

A PAST Optimization Framework for Parrot ,The Perl Foundation,Tyler Curtis,"Currently, very few, if any, optimizations are automatically applied by Parrot to code running on it. Any optimizations must be implemented in the specific compilers or at a low level, resulting in some compilers, such as Not Quite Perl, lacking even very useful optimizations such as tail call elimination. With a simple common framework for easily implementing optimizations, it will be much easier for HLLs on Parrot to be optimized more powerfully and perform more quickly."
Adding support for binary data in Rakudo,The Perl Foundation,Carl Mäsak,"Currently in Rakudo (the most actively developed Perl 6 implementation), when you try to open a file which happens to contain non-UTF-8 data, it dies with ""Malformed UTF-8 string"". The project aims to fix this, as well as add support for the Buf type to Rakudo. The Buf type in Perl 6 is slated to be able to hold arbitrary binary data."
Ctypes for Perl,The Perl Foundation,Ryan Jendoubi,"Using shared libraries from Perl should be as easy as stating the library and function you want, and letting 'something' take care of the rest. That something is a simple but powerful foreign function interface module, akin to Python's ctypes.Like the Inline:: family, a ctypes-style module would save perl authors from having to write and compile, but going further, would enable the wrapping of external libraries using Pure Perl instead of C."
Hybrid Threads for Parrot,The Perl Foundation,Nat Tuck,Modern programming systems need to provide support for both parallel execution on multiprocessor systems and concurrent programming style to model naturally concurrent problems. This project will implement a threading system for Parrot that will allow a large number of logically concurrent tasks to execute efficiently on multiple physical processors by multiplexing many concurrent tasks to a smaller set of OS threads.

This project aims to enhance the user experience, accessibility, performance improvement in the system's functionalities. "
Implement private resources handling für FLOW3/TYPO3 5.0,TYPO3 Association,t3andi,"Private files are a known problem in web applications. There are a bunch of extensions for TYPO3 available that handle this issue in the one or the other fashion. For TYPO3 5.0 we aim for a solution that is really secure and still does not need to pass the files through the PHP process. Besides that different deployment strategies like local or a CDN should be taken into account.If time permits we can also go for channel security features like encrypted transfer or signing the data."
Modular Community System,TYPO3 Association,Pascal J,"TYPO3 has a great feature-set and many extensions for nearly every purpose. However, a field that is missing attention is the community: on the TYPO3 website, typo3.org, there is no possibility to connect with other developers/users that one met at community events like the T3DD.TYPO3 needs a community extension that is flexible and easy to use. The extension would have basic features like messaging, profiles and groups. Users of TYPO3 and the TYPO3 website would benefit from that extension."
Android U1: Ubuntu One client for Android,Ubuntu,Michał Karnicki,"The aim of the project is to deliver Ubuntu One service to Android powered devices. The application would enable Ubuntu users not only to browse files in the cloud from their phone, but also share experience on the spot using URLs to their published U1 resources, instantly upload camera pictures or download music.

Harvest user interface improvements,Ubuntu,Dylan McCall,"In this proposal, I describe a project where I enhance Harvest's user interface to be friendlier and more flexible. The three main features are a filtering interface, sprinkles of AJAX and simpler individual pages. Time permitting, I would also work on on a new landing page to make the service more inviting."
Home user backup solution/Deja Dup improvements,Ubuntu,Neo,Linux offers a lot of great backup tools that are used with great satisfaction by enterprise and server market but it has neglected ordinary home users that do not wish to become skilled computer administrators to make sure their documents are safe for far too long. Deja Dup began to change that quite successfully but still has a long way to go to offer great experience to its users not just when they stumble upon it but rather from day one from Ubuntu's installation.
services-admin configuration and Upstart-ification,Ubuntu,Jacob Peddicord,"services-admin, currently included in the GNOME system tools, is a great utility to easily enable and disable services. However, it lacks the ability to manage Upstart jobs, making it less useful on some systems.The goal of this project is to provide a unified interface, in services-admin and backends, for managing both older scripts and Upstart jobs.Additionally, an interface will be provided that allows users to easily change service-specific configuration without editing files by hand."
Software Center Improvements,Ubuntu,pgg,This project brings many smaller improvements to the current implementation of software-center. Gdebi and apturl integration will be part of this project. The other components of this project are very flexible and can be determined on a week to week basis. Some suggestions are provided in the project proposal.

Add Shader support using DirectX/OpenGL API for video post-processing,VideoLAN,skoruga,"A lot of video post-processing such as RGB-YUV conversion can be accelerated by using the GPU. This can either be achieved through a fragment shader, where it is the last step before a pixel is displayed on the screen, or it can be done with DirectCompute/CUDA/OpenCL. The method will vary depending on the task and intent. I will implement support for shaders by using the DirectX and OpenGL API and write a few shaders such as RGB-YUV conversion."

Audio support for the x264 frontend,VideoLAN,Kovensky,"Audio support on the x264 frontend.The plan is to, at the end of the project, have x264 capable of transcoding or copying audio as simply and correctly as possible.Usage should be as simple as 'x264 input -o output', with eventual support for {down,up}mixing and resampling.The used library for decoding and encoding will initially be libavcodec, but more libraries can be used in the future."
High-Level Capture API for Phonon,VideoLAN,Casian Andrei,"The goal of this project would be to create an API to allow Phonon application to display and access input devices, like webcams. The API would then be implemented in phonon-vlc and other backends, such as phonon-gst, as time permits."
Higher bit depth encoding support for x264,VideoLAN,Oskar Arvidsson,"Currently x264 is constrained to encoding videos with a sample depth of 8 bits. This often suffices for consumer needs, but for production purposes and high quality video encoding, it may not be sufficient.The primary goal for this project is to prepare the code base for encoding H.264 video with user defined sample depths."
Implementing BD-J support in libbluray and VLC,VideoLAN,Will Hahne,"This project will focus primarily on getting BD-J (Blu-ray Disc Java) support into libbluray. BD-J support is important because many of the advanced features and extra content in Blu-ray movies uses BD-J. Currently people with Blu-ray drives are tied to Windows if they want to access this content, they are forced to use proprietary Blu-ray software which does not run on Linux or various other operating systems. This project will also integrate the BD-J support into VLC."
Improving Matroska and ASF demuxers,VideoLAN,Juho Vähä-Herttua,"Some VLC demuxers could be improved, especially with seeking to I-frames and supporting new or rarely seen formats. This project aims to improve the Matroska and ASF demuxers in particular. Main working methods are browsing the bugtracker and writing tests and finding test files for the current code, and most important of all communicating with the people involved. Alternative refactored versions of both Matroska and ASF plugins are also introduced for possible merging."

Ogg and Matroska demuxers,VideoLAN,salsaman,"A demuxer, or demultiplexer, is an essential part of the audio/video decoding process. Its role is to work with the container format, to identify the types and properties of the streams (video, audio, subtitles), control seeking and synch within the container, and to feed stream packets into the appropriate decoders.My project would be to rewrite the ogg and matroska demuxers in VLC so that they work correctly and allow rapid, frame accurate seeking within files with these container types."
PCM I/O API for Phonon,VideoLAN,Michael Forney,"Design a fully featured PCM I/O API for Phonon, and provide an implementation for the Phonon-VLC backend and one other (either MPlayer or Xine). This API will allow developers to capture PCM data from devices like a sound card, or to play back raw audio from memory, or elsewhere. This will provide some importantmissing features in Phonon, and open the door for many applications waiting to make use of an API like this."

General RDF export/import in Semantic MediaWiki,Wikimedia Foundation,Samuel Lampa,"Rework and extend the import/export functionality of Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) to allow also full, general RDF import.One motivation and use case is to use SMW as a collaborative RDF editor integrated with workflow / workbench software like Bioclipse, for workflows of the type:Import RDF --> Collaboratively edit --> Export in same formatThe project will include general reworkings of the import/export functionality though, which that specific use case can take advantage of."
"Improve metadata support for uploaded media in mediawiki by displaying and extracting embedded IPTC, XMP, and other metadata formats.",Wikimedia Foundation,bawolff,"Currently Mediawiki only supports displaying jpeg exif metadata on image pages. Some other metadata can also be returned using the api prop=imageinfo&iiprop=metadata, however this is not that useful to the average viewer since it is not displayed. I propose as my project (should I be accepted and all that) to improve Mediawiki's support for metadata of uploaded files. This would include extracting metadata for more media formats, and displaying the metadata on image pages where it is useful. "

This would include transferring over much of the Javascript to use the jQuery library, which is now becoming a MediaWiki standard"
Reasonably efficient interwiki template transclusion,Wikimedia Foundation,Peter Potrowl,"The aim is to be able to include templates from another wiki on the WikiMedia Foundation wikis. This functionality has been requested since 2004 and has already been added to MediaWiki but is *not* enabled on WMF wikis because of performance problems. A bug report (#9890) opened in 2007 describes a solution to those problems, but it needs ""a substantial amount of code"" and someone doing it. That's what I propose to do."
Wikisource Legal Tool,Wikimedia Foundation,Stephen,"Creating a tool to format judicial decisions, legal scholarship, and statutes for Wikisource."
A Visual CSS Editor,WordPress,Daryl Koopersmith,Create a CSS editor that will be easily integrated to existing themes and provide users with a better alternative to theme options.
An Advanced Theme Editor and Revisioning System,WordPress,Andrew Nacin,"I intend to build an advanced theme editing and revisioning system. The main focus would be to develop revisioning and snapshots for theme files (and themes themselves). In some respects, the project is a bundled series of improvements of the existing theme editor, which the project aims to replace in core. Revisions would be stored as a custom post type and would be backed by a diff engine. Additional goals are to identify and implement a replacement for CodePress and sandbox functions.php."
Automatic WordPress Migration,WordPress,Brian McKenna,"At the moment a lot of developers use a staging server (e.g. blog.localhost) and then migrate their changes onto a ""live"" site. The current problem is that WordPress is very hard to migrate to a new host (e.g. blog.brianmckenna.org to briansblog.com).This solution would create a simple and effective user interface for migrating a WordPress installation to a new host."
BuddyPress as a teaching tool,WordPress,Sтаs Sușcov,The idea is to port/implement ScholarPress as a component into BuddyPress.
BuddyPress: Multimedia component and Moderation component,WordPress,Francesco Laffi,"2 Buddypress plugins: add multimedia capability and upload from remote to bp-album plugin; code a moderation plugin that adds ""report this"" links to posted contents, so members can easily report unappropriate content and site admins can easily take action on reported contents from wp backend."
Comment Moderation Improvements,WordPress,Matt Harzewski,"I would like to work on an enhancement of the current WordPress comment moderation tools. In particular, I would like to add a way to re-assign a comment to a different parent thread. For some reason, many commentators ignore the threading and leave their message as a root-level comment. It would be very handy to have a way for users with sufficient privileges to move a comment into a different thread. Also, I think the Admin could use better threaded comment support."
"Dashboard ""Setup Completion"" Module",WordPress,bumbu,"When you first set up a WordPress site, there are certain steps you have to go through: pick a theme, change your password, edit your tagline, choose your comment settings, etc. On the Dashboard screen there will be a module that kept track of how many of these things you’ve done, and marked off your progress. Each successive login would offer the user an option to finish/enhance their site setup by completing another thing(s) they haven’t gotten around to yet."

Full-Throttle Trac Annihilation,WordPress,Wojtek Szkutnik,"The goal of the project is to annihilate as much issues from WP trac as possible. My goal is to close 72 issues (one per day), although if I complete it sooner, I will be working full steam on fixing other bugs until the deadline."
Specialized Theme for Ideas & Feedback,WordPress,Justin Shreve,"The current WordPress Idea Forum is a useful and necessary way for the project to receive feedback and accept feature requests from the WordPress user-base. However, there are certain features that could be improved and refined to make the forum even more effective. Just as P2 impacted Automattic positively by allowing instant collaboration on posts and topics, I believe a new specialized ""ideas"" theme would foster user-base collaboration on ideas in the Idea Forum."
WordPress Achievements,WordPress,Mike Whitfield,"WordPress Achievements seeks to reward beginning developers and veterans for ways they are involved with WordPress.WordPress Achievements will offer beginning developers a way to measure their progress.This can be a life-saver, as the amount of information to newcomers can often seem insurmountable.Veteran developers can have fun trying to earn more involved goals, e.g. ""got huge amounts of traffic and survived"".This is a great way to keep the interest going in WordPress as a community."
WordPress File API Stream Wrapper Support,WordPress,Jon Stacey,The goal of this project is to improve the file handling capabilities of WordPress by making PHP's stream wrapper functionality a part of the File API. PHP stream wrappers allow virtually any type of resource to be represented as a normal file. Stream wrappers will make the implementation details of file management transparent to developers fostering cross plugin interoperability and increasing the flexibility of WordPress.

Improve input support for XCB,X.Org,chr,"As XCB implements only an incomplete subset of keyboard functions, its employment by application programmers is somewhat hindered. This is even amplified by the fact that complete XKB protocol descriptions have been added in 2009, but libxcb still lacks support due to missing code generators. In the course of this project the XCB keyboard support should be extended to enable XKB-unaware, XKB-capable or even XKB-aware applications. "
Improve the GLSL Compiler Backend for the R300 Driver,X.Org,tstellar,The goal of this project is to increase the number of GLSL features supported by the R300 driver.GLSL is an important part of the OpenGL specification and is widely used by modern graphics programs. Increasing the number of GLSL features that the R300 driver supports will ensure that users can run the programs they want.
KMS for Permedia3/4 as a method for Documenting the KMS driver writing process,X.Org,Matt Turner,"Kernel mode-setting allows for faster and more graphical boots with fewer flickers. Only the big three drivers, Radeon, Intel, and Nouveau, support KMS, but there are many more X11 drivers that could benefit as well. Unfortunately, the big three drivers are large and complex, and is there no official documentation for writing KMS drivers. This project aims to provide both documentation for writing KMS drivers and a basic, unaccelerated, reference KMS driver for Permedia3-series hardware."

"GIMME - GIMME Interesting Music, Mr. Emacs!",XMMS2,konr,A client for xmms2 on Emacs that puts an interestingly strong weight on searching and (mis)using collections as search results. The goal is quickly finding out what the user feels like playing. 
Mergeable S4 with Coll 2.0,XMMS2,Cippo,"S4 is the new medialib backend for XMMS2. It has turned out to work pretty well, but it still has some bugs and shortcomings that needs to be fixed before it can be the new official backend. It would also be desirable to add Collections 2.0 (a more expressive collections framework) to make it even more usable."
XMMS2 mobile web client for iPhone and Android devices,XMMS2,Cherif Yaya,"The goal is be to develop a web application that runs on mobile devices and acts as a client for an XMMS2 daemon. The application will be a remote the user can use to control playback, manage playlists and query the media library. A web client is a good approach because with the new HTML5/CSS features it's now possible to create great user experiences using only portable web technologies. The two deliverables for this project are the python xmms2 client and the mobile web application."
Chat Reliability Improvements and MUC User Interface Overhaul,XMPP Standards Foundation,Tobias Markmann,"This project is about improving the reliability of the XMPP stream between Psi and XMPP servers and user interface improvements.Implementing XEP-0198 and XEP-0184 will hopefully improve reliability and redesigning the MUC user interfaces will highly improveoverall user experience and make it easier for users who are new to instant messaging to chat with other people."

Jingle File Transfer and XTLS support for gajim,XMPP Standards Foundation,Zhenchao Li(fantasticsid),Jingle is an advanced protocol for negotiating and managing media sessions between two entities. File transfer over jingle is currently not supported in gajim. I propose to implement jingle file transfer for gajim and add support to XTLS for data encryption. This will both benefit users of gajim and serve as another implementation of jingle file transfer and thus help the XSF community to better shape related protocols.
Server Side Message Archiving For Prosody,XMPP Standards Foundation,DaiZW,"Currently many XMPP clients save the messages locally and it's not convenient or even possible to retrieve the historical messages, especially when one switches the clients a lot.So it will be much more easier if the XMPP server supports server-side message archiving. In this case, the clients can retrieve archived messages anytime and anywhere.XMPP Extension Proposal XEP-0136 is defined for this purpose. This project will implement XEP-0136 for Prosody."
Blender 2.5 Integration with YafaRay,YafaRay (Yet Another Free Raytracer),shuvro sarker,"Blender2.50 is much more powerful now than any previous version of blender. And the exporter for YafaRay can give YafaRay users the way to use their favorite renderer right inside the Blender interface. YafaRay has some options that are different from Blender. So the export system will take those extra parameters from the userin a user friendly fashion and can also use the parameters that are common to both Blender and YafaRay. After feeding these data to YafaRay,It can do it's magic."
Irradiance Caching In Photon Mapping Integrator,YafaRay (Yet Another Free Raytracer),Glaskows,"Irradiance Caching is a technique for computing global illumination on diffuse surfaces reasonably fast.IC can be used inside Yafaray's two-pass photon mapping algorithm, specifically for improving the speed and quality of indirect illumination on diffuse (Lambertian) surfaces, which is the most costly component to compute in a Monte Carlo ray tracer (this is the case even if we only compute the first bounce of diffuse illumination, like in Final Gather)."
Microrendering for Scalable Final Gathering,YafaRay (Yet Another Free Raytracer),Szakats Istvan,"The productivity of artists working on high quality photorealistic renders of 3D scenes, especially 3D animations, is limited by the long time to wait for the image to be computed. Microrendering is a novel approach to the final gathering phase of several physically based rendering algorithms that by making use of the massively parallel nature of modern GPUs is able to improve the rendering speed to real time rates."
Progressive Photon Mapping,YafaRay (Yet Another Free Raytracer),ryen,Progressive photon mapping is a multi-pass algorithm where the first pass is ray tracing followed by any number of photon tracing passes. Each photon tracing pass results in an increasingly accurate global illumination solution that can be visualized in order to provide progressive feedback. 
SubSurface Scattering,YafaRay (Yet Another Free Raytracer),Yong Li,"SubSurface Scattering material is very common in daily life, such as jade, marble, and human skin, and a lot of algorithms and models are proposed for rendering this material. However Yafaray still doesn't support this material up to now. So this project will implement subsurface scattering shader for Yafaray, and this shader should work across all Yafaray lighting methods. The main goal of this project is to make user could easily render organic materials, plastics, human skin, etc."
YafaRay Exporter or plug-in for Maya,YafaRay (Yet Another Free Raytracer),Maitreya,"YafaRay is used a lot in Blender.But till now YafaRay does not have a formal version for Maya. I'd like to integrate YafaRay and Maya, making YafaRay as an exporter or plug-in for Maya."
ASTSIE - Advanced Semantic Tools for the Scala IDE for Eclipse,"École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Scala team",Jin Mingjian,The Scala programming language has a number of features which would benefit from additional feedback in programming tools and IDEs. It would be very desirable to have support in the Scala tooling for Eclipse for kinds of advanced semantic analysis tools to make the Scala IDE for Eclipse more productive. 
Collaborative Scaladoc,"École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Scala team",Petr Hosek,"Scala is new programming language allowing to build new systems faster and easier. During last months,Scala started to gain more and more attention in the programmers community. Therefore, it is important to provide quality documentation as this is the part that many new Scala programmers heavily rely on. Collaborative way of creating documentation can improve its quality and improve its comprehensibility."
"ENSIME, a new Scala development environment for Emacs","École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Scala team",Aemon Cannon,"Emacs modes usually lack sophisticated IDE functions such as type checking, type inspection and method completion. Since the introduction of the Scala Presentation Compiler, it is now possible for an IDE to interact directly with the Scala compiler, leveraging the core type checking and type inference support. The ENSIME project aims to expose the Presentation Compiler to Emacs in a client/server architecture similar to SLIME, in order to provide advanced Scala IDE functionality to Emacs users."
Hardware Accelerated 2D Graphics,"École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Scala team",Dariusz Kosz,"Aim for this project is to build hardware accelerated kind of engine for 2D drawing system for Scala. Using advantage that Scala is compatible with Java, in this case JOGL which is Java bindings for OpenGL would be use. To achieve possible high performance with well-look and ""fancy"" effect I plan to use great innovation for graphic libraries - shaders. That 2D engine will be API which will lets users customise shaders for all rendered objects (primitives, images, figures etc)."
