These can be ordered by frequency or recency, as well as searched, and will allow for the user to launch new conversations with his contacts directly from Gnome Shell itself, whereupon they will be handled by the user‚Äôs preferred Telepathy client."
Porting Jokosher to PyGI and GTK+3,GNOME Project,Peteris Krisjanis (Pƒìteris Kri≈°jƒÅnis),"I will port Jokosher from PyGTK code base to PyGI (Python GObject Introspection) and new GTK+3 toolkit, fixing PyGI bugs and rewriting custom widgets for GTK+3. Additionally, I also will work on better Jokosher integration with GNOME 3 environment."
Adaptive Cloning (aka Seamless cloning),GNU Image Manipulation Program,Barak Itkin,"Direct cloning of parts from one image to another, usually ends in bad results because of different lighting conditions and other settings (such as white-balance) which causes the color of the cloned part not to match the source image and look out of place. There are some techniques to solve this, by using poisson equations and some other methods.This suggestion allows a fast (realtime) solution for allowing to paste seamlessly parts from one image to another."
iWarp like tool for Gimp,GNU Image Manipulation Program,Michael Mur√©,"Idea:The goal is to implement a live on-canvas iWarp like tool.Behavior:The basic usecase of this tool would be:1.

Replace GimpSizeEntry widget,GNU Image Manipulation Program,Enrico Schr√∂der,"The GimpSizeEntry widget in its current form, which is used across the user interface for entering values and their corresponding units (e.g. image dimensions, lengths, etc.), has a couple of issues both from a users and a developers standpoint. The project is to rewrite the widget being based on GtkEntry with the ability to directly enter and display the desired unit in the text field itself instead of in an external control. Simple mathematical terms for the input of values in different units will be possible using the existing parser (gimpeevl)."
automake - Interfacing with a test protocol like TAP or subunit,GNU Project ,Stefano Lattarini,"TAP and SubUnit are simple text-based protocols allowing communication between test scripts and a test harness.They allow a single test script to run several distinct checks.Primary objective of this project is the implementation of a TAP/SubUnit consumer testsuite harness in Automake-generated Makefiles, allowing more granularity in the report and count of checks.A secondary objective is to enhance Autotest-generated test scripts to make them able to produce TAP and/or SubUnit output."
Denemo - Restructure MIDI and audio backends and make JACK support realtime-capable,GNU Project ,Dominic Sacr√©,"Denemo supports a variety of MIDI and audio backends, all of which offer different feature sets. The goal of this proposal is to clean up, restructure and partly rewrite the MIDI and audio code, so that all currently implemented features can be used irrespective of the underlying audio API. Once input/output, soundfont rendering and GUI code are clearly separated from each other, ensuring the realtime-safety of Denemo's JACK support will be relatively easy."
gdb - Enhancing Support for Debugging Operating Systems in x86 Environments,GNU Project ,Anthony Eden,"My proposal is to extend GDB‚Äôs capabilities of debugging operating systems by adding x86 architecture specific commands, robust support for transitioning between operating modes, and modifying the remote protocol to allow virtualization software such as QEMU use GDB more effectively in debugging operating systems."

Whole Slide Imaging in Pathology,Grassroots DICOM,Manoj Alwani,"DICOM currently defines Image IODs by storing the rows and columns as unsigned short integer. This means that an image can only be at most of size 2^16 * 2^16 pixels. This is a limitation for Microscopy Images as, for example, WSI can go up to Terabytes in extreme conditions.In addition to these ‚Äúhard‚Äù restrictions, another consideration is due to large amount of information in these images rapid panning and zooming should also be supported."
"Animated effects, clip transformation and titles for PiTiVi",GStreamer,lubosz,"Animated effects in PiTiVi. A possibility to transform clips with panning, zoom and rotation. Procedural clips like text and shapes. A final goal might be to have a PiTiVi where you can make rotating stars, becoming unfocused with a animated blur effect without the use of external assets."
Automated Compositing in PiTiVi using Optical Flow with GStreamer,GStreamer,David Jordan,"Making compositing fast and easy for the user will let independent filmmakers create effects that are too time consuming to create using existing open source software like the GIMP or Blender.This project will allow users to cut out layers in many frames of video quickly, allowing them to add partially-occluded objects into existing scenes and perform other effects like per-object color correction.This will be done via optical flow (motion vector) plugins for GStreamer and an UI for PiTiVi."
"PiTiVi - Implementing Render Profiles, Video Uploading and GUI Enhancements",GStreamer,Feroze Naina,"I hope to implement: Rendering presets - Enable users to select their output format without codec/container knowledge. Also let us package a default set of presets. Should be able to export and import presets. Video Uploader - To directly upload video to services like YouTube, DailyMotion, Vimeo and Archive.org. To code various GUI enhancements demanded by the PiTiVi community to make PiTiVi intuitive to use even for a video editing newbie."
Plugins for Editing,GStreamer,Roland Elek,"GStreamer is a cross-platform pipeline-based multimedia framework extensible using plugins.

VirtualBox guest additions for Haiku,Haiku,Mike Smith,"Haiku currently runs well in VirtualBox, and all basic emulated hardware works well enough for general use. However, there is currently no port of the guest additions to Haiku, so the emulated system is not as usable as it could be. I propose to implement these additions to provide extra features such as seamless mouse pointer integration, clipboard sharing, and automatic screen resizing."
Build multiple Cabal packages in parallel,haskell.org,Mikhail Glushenkov,"Cabal is a system for building and packaging Haskell libraries and programs. This project's aim is to augment Cabal with support for building packages in parallel. Many developers have multi-core machines, but Cabal runs the build process in a single thread, only making use of one core. If the build process could be parallelized, build times could be cut by perhaps a factor of 2-8, depending on the number of cores and opportunity of parallel execution available."
Convert the text package to use UTF‚Äì8 internally,haskell.org,Jasper Van der Jeugt,"For Haskell projects handling unicode text, the Text library offers both speed and simplicity-of-use. When it was written, benchmarks indicated that UTF-16 would be a good choice for the internal encoding in the library. However, these (rather artificial) benchmarks were did not take into account the time taken to 1) decode the ""Real World"" data and 2) encode it to write it back. I propose to 1) benchmark and 2) convert the library to UTF-8 if it is a faster choice for ""Real World""-applications."
Darcs Bridge,haskell.org,Owen Stephens,"My proposed project is to create a generic bridge that will enable easy interoperability and synchronisation between Darcs and other VCSs. The bridge will be designed to be generic, but the focus of this project will be Darcs2 <-> Git and Darcs2 <-> Darcs1. The bridge should allow loss-less, correct conversion to and from Darcs repositories, allowing users to use the tool that suits them and their project best, be that Darcs as it currently exists, or another tool."
Darcs: primitive patches version 3,haskell.org,Petr Roƒçkai,"Darcs, a revision control system, uses so-called patches to represent changes to individual version-controlled files, where the ""primitive"" patches are the lowest level of this representation, capturing notions like ""hunks"" (akin to what diff(1) produces), token replace and file and directory addition/removal. I propose to implement a different representation of these primitive patches, hoping to improve both performance and flexibility of darcs and to facilitate future development."
Improve EclipseFP,haskell.org,Alejandro Serrano,"Eclipse is one of the most popular IDEs in our days. EclipseFP is a project developing a plug-in for it that supports Haskell. Now, it has syntax highlighting, integration of GHCi and supports some properties of Cabal files. My idea is to extend the set of tools available, at least with:- Autocompletion and better links to documentation,- A way to run unit tests within Eclipse,- More support for editing Cabal files visually, including a browser of the available packages."
Interpreter Support for the Cabal-Install Build Tool,haskell.org,anklesaria,This project aims to provide cabal-install with an 'repl <source>' command by adding to the Cabal API. This would allow package developers to use GHCi and Hugs from within packages requiring options and preprocessing from Cabal.

Semantic Schemas extension,Wikimedia Foundation,Ankit Garg,"Short summary: Semantic Schemas a proposed extension , that would let users and admins define everything about the wiki's data structure via XML contained within wiki pages. That XML in turn would be used to generate all the other relevant pages: templates, properties, forms, etc. And the XML would be editable via a helper form, so that ideally users would never have to do direct XML editing. Also, the XML could theoretically be imported from, and exported to, other data-structure formats."
Working Archival for Web Ciations,Wikimedia Foundation,nn123654,"Web Citations are currently the most popular form of citation on the Wikipedia project for inline references. They have the common of ""dieing"" when the URLs either change or the servers that they are hosted on go down. Given the nature of wikipedia and the need for verifiability this creates a significant content problem when sources that are used in articles are no longer available."

The bridge is in the responsibility of WordPress.org team and the plugin project is in my responsibility."
learn.wordpress.org,WordPress,St–∞s Su»ôcov,"WordPress doesn't have an official handbook or a tutorial resources website. Even though the platform is very popular and used by a lot of people, there will always be people that will find hard to read/understand Codex articles and will search for books on topics they couldn't catch up. So the idea I would like to work on, is a new learning resource for WordPress community, that will offer courses, assignments and basic ""certification"" for everyone who wants to learn WordPress."
LocalStorage drafts backup,WordPress,Mihai Chereji,"My vision is that at the end of this project, a WordPress user will not care at if any time during him/her writing a post on his blog, his Internet connection goes down.Editing files (and posts) on the client and using localStorage to save drafts when the Internet connection goes down can make everyone‚Äôs experience with WordPress a lot more safe and maybe a little more enjoyable."
Refresh the Android App UI,WordPress,Anirudh S,"The UI for existing features could be more user-friendly. e.g. a dashboard-kind of an interface. This would lead to quick blogging on the go and remove unnecessary steps while performing basic operations like posting a new post, pictures and videos. Removing the current tab-kind of an interface and bringing in a grid interface like the current Twitter and Facebook app. The UX would also have to be improved. This means large buttons, easy to browse-interface and smooth graphic flows too."
Template Versioning Using Subversion,WordPress,David Julia,"I propose the creation of an interface for version control systems for the templates which integrates the display of revision information into the theme editor page.

Porting Wombat Asset Management System on to Flask (a developer friendly python framework) and integrate a 3D model viewer into the system,WorldForge,Pronoy Chopra,Wombat currently runs on Pylons 0.9.7 which is outdated. Porting Wombat to Flask is primarily because Flask is more developer friendly and subsequent updates don't really have lots of changes. Wombat was made to assist artists to work with assets in a repository without having to work with the VCS. Also a 3D assets viewer is required because game development repository has 3D models which have to be downloaded and viewed. Rather than that a preview should be given so that the job becomes easier.

Add Xen PV block device support to SeaBIOS,Xen.org,Daniel Castro,"Currently Xen is using for HVM Virtual machines a version of BIOS called rombios, ROMBIOS is functional but maintenance is difficult, it is a mixture of C and inline assembly.Xen wants to migrate to SeaBIOS, which happens to also be the qemu upstream and KVM BIOS of choice, that means that the source code is more maintainable.Then a modification to int0x13 will be done to use the PV Drivers via XenStore instead of the emulated device used in qemu."
Linux Based Stubdoms,Xen.org,Jiageng Yu,"Stubdoms are very small Xen PV guests used to run some software components that otherwise live in dom0. This project will implement a linux based stubdom, which provides device emulation to a particular HVM guest. Because we are using PV linux kernel and upstream qemu to build the system, there are many new problems to be addressed, such as: establishing the environment of linux based stubdom with minimal linux kernel and shared libraries which can contain the qemu process exactly, adapting simulation devices to their relevant frontend devices in an optimal way, addressing the save/restore problem, adding pci pass-through support, etc."
Paravirtualized audio,Xen.org,Giorgos Boutsioukis,"The project would be to implement paravirtualized audio in Xen, in some form. Two approaches are proposed: a high-level approach over PulseAudio and a low-level split device driver, similar to the existing."

Audio converter rewrite and multichannel support,XMMS2 - X-platform Music Multiplexing System 2,Juho V√§h√§-Herttua,"Currently the XMMS2 converter is a large chunk of python generated code doing sample format conversion, linear interpolation and channel mixing. There has been suggestions to use libsamplerate, which is probably the best audio conversion library around, but its GPLv2 license is not suitable for the project. Goal is to add similar functionality with more liberal license, most likely something like LGPLv2+. At least the functionality of the current converter plus multichannel should be available."
GIMME 2 - My proposal for GSoC 2011,XMMS2 - X-platform Music Multiplexing System 2,konr,"GIMME, originally developed for Google's Summer of Code in 2010, is a well-rounded XMMS2 interface for GNU Emacs that provides a minimalistic and intuitive user experience through searches, powered by collection operations. It works very nicely, but still lacks the polishing top-quality Emacs packages have, modern features other interfaces have and a userbase. I propose to work on all of these issues in this summer."
LADSPA plugin support and improved effects chain management,XMMS2 - X-platform Music Multiplexing System 2,mantaraya36,"Currently XMMS2 only possesses a very basic selection of audio processes that can be added to the signal chain. Since LADSPA plugins offer complex functionality it will be important to enhance the configuration interface to support richer data interchange, through the development of a schema mechanism for properties and dynamic modification of effect chains."
Service Clients,XMMS2 - X-platform Music Multiplexing System 2,Guilherme Gon√ßalves,"This proposal aims to revise, extend and finish the implementation of ServiceClients in XMMS2 started in 2008 by Dan Chokola, document its functionality,and integrate it with the rest of the code base and test framework."
